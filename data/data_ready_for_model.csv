The information given was this would get fixed within a week. A week later I am told 7-Oct we will get connected as the job requires external work. A few days before that date it gets postponed to 24-Oct. I am staying home to be around that date but nothing happens. New date given was 14-Nov. Last week I called to confirm this and also asked for confirmation on VM forum chat and was told ""yes"" it will get done. Then on 14-Nov nothing happens, then sms asking to contact VM. Information ""there is external cable work scheduled for today. unfortunately we are unable to send our crew today"". Next available date 28-Nov.Sorry but I have had enough. Will switch, get my money back from VM what I have paid so far (coz the emails re ""your bill is ready"" come promptly, plus recommendations on what wonderful new movies I should be watching). Enough is enough",1.0
1,"A truly attrocious service, both in terms of broadband and customer services. My broadband has had issues from day 1 of the service and was told to increase my broadband package to improve this. I paid more for this and even then the service kept cutting out during important zoom calls.  Their customer services does not have a clue and all they seem to want you to do is reboot your router several times.   The final straw came when I was left without broadband for over a week so decided I had had enough and was going to cancel the service. When I called to cancel the services they said their computer system was down so could not cancel my service.  3 days later and I am still waiting for my services to be cancelled.  This really is appalling and would recommend anyone who is considering moving to Virgin Media to stop and rethink.",1.0
2,"They make it as hard as they can for you to cancel a contract. I was on the phone for 2 hours, had t o spend 20 minutes convinving the first agent I wanted to cancel, who then put me on hold for 1+hours waiting for a different agent. That agent hung up as soon as we connected. Two days later I'm not in a text chat that will apparently take all day. DON'T USE THEM! YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS!",2.0
3,"Pay for the 350Mbps package but only ever managed 250Mbps, upload only 34 of the 50 adverised. router is garbage, 5G wifi drops out and all other interfaces reset when it happens.  settings often disappearing  customer service not a great experience",2.0
4,"The worst customer service:-The bots ask irrelevant questions-After many questions you can be told they cant help as they are too busy-You go through security and then get transferred to whatsapp-You then have to go through security againLong waiting times between answers on whats app, up to 10-15 minutes-Questions have no bearing to the issue, its like a bot again-Loads of copy and paste: dont worry, i know how u feel, i would be too, but never get to the issue, its like a bot again-Was told the information they have access to is limited so they end up asking you questions, such as, did you receive an email, who did u speak to, etc-Silly policies dictate illogical offers-Orders will get cancelled without explanations -Support is an exercise going through the motionsThe most frustrating",2.0

6,"I wish I can give a Zero star to virgin media but unfortunately the lowest star is 1. If you intend joining a network and don't want your bills to keep increasing without being informed then please don't make the mistake of joing virgin media. They are set of liars and they lied to me in May 2019 that if I join there network I will pay Â£33 pounds for 18 month contract. After 4 month of being with virgin media, they increase there price to Â£59 pounds month, which wasn't what they initially told me. When I realised that they've increased there monthly bill, I had to end the contract, because I ended the contract they further bill me of Â£102.27, a bill that I never used and insisted that I have to pay, they began to send the debt collector to disturb me about the payment, they spoilt my credit rating as they reported the case to the credit authority and my credit has been affected by them.If you love your credit report, and don't want to keep on paying extra bills in comparison with what you initially agree, Don't join virgin media.Lastly, when I saw that they've gone a bit further to spoil my credit report, I contacted them to voice out my complain, one of there customer service Listened to my complain and confirmed that my bills have been written off via there online chat service, after 2 weeks of confirming that my bill have been written off, they came back to say that was not what they meant that I still have make payment of Â£102.27. I showed them the evidence that confirms that my bill has been written off, but they said written off means I will have to pay. I wonder how stupid this people are that they taught they are tricking a kid. In conclusion, if you love your credit score and don't want excessive bills after some certain month of joining a network, please Don't attempt joining virgin media  they are liars looking for ways to extort customers.",1.0
7,I was sold a package for 1gb speed and 2 tivo box 6 but when i ask for it they act like i am not given those. Get everything in proper writing. Their sales team are there to just put you on a contract and then they remove what is promised.,2.0
8,"Quite simply you don't get what your sold. For example if you are say switching from BT 67mb package to Virgins 108 mb package you will notice the following.1) Your actual wi fi speeds will more than likely be slower than BT. Id say I got an average of 30mb download speed compared to about 50+ with BT.2) Your wi fi signal from the HUB 3 will not have the range compared to the BT hub 23) Speaking to someone is near impossible unless you book a day off work to sit on the phone on the plus side I found it more reliable than BT but maybe Ive been lucky?",3.0
9,Virgin is just the worse broadband company. Iâve been trying to book an engineer for months and finally got it booked last week for Monday (7th November) and guess what???? I called them on Monday to confirm the visit and they said it wasnât booked,1.0
10,"very rude and unhelpful. I tried to make a complaint, but the call handler refused to put me through to a manager and said âall complaints are through herâ and I wouldnât get a follow up response. I tried to raise a complaint on the website but the link wasnât working.  Iâm incredibly disappointed! Iâve been overcharged, and was promised a Â£68.72 refund. Iâve received Â£14. I cannot face going through another ordeal again.  Virgin you win, but you will never have my business again!",2.0
11,"Absolutely useless service ,no communication and treat the customer the worst I had  received a payment overdue from them a few days ago and all of a sudden they cut my internet connection. I do have a direct debit with them every month which I am paying my monthly bill. had  attached my bank statements to them by email and was expecting  from them  to fix my internet connection promptly and apologise for their mistake or compensate me for all this days that i have to pay from my pocket to have some internet at home but after 5 days nobody communicate with me ,when i try to call them the automatic answer machine says that my account is freezed and have to do the payment for them to be able to unfreeze it Literally i don't have words to express my frustration I will certainly discuss it with my solicitor and get another broadband that cares about their customers",2.0
12,I can't describe how bad is the internet connection 4 weeks now I have to use my mobile data so I can work 3 times I book a appointment for technical services to come and check and 3 times they cancelled and the best is that when I called they said we check and everything is working fine just I don't know what else to do.,2.0
13,"WIFI is usually fast and up to expected speed stated in the package. We used the 200 MB student plan. Occasional service outage especially during heat waves in summer, unfortunately due to the old infrastructure in our area.  Satisfactory customer service. Waiting time is usually around 40 minutes, better than most other companies (for example the energy companies, try not to be a customer of SSE btw). Installation was quick and on time. We were able to cancel the service on the Whatsapp Customer Service, which took about an hour of discrete chat with one of their moving team members. But the response was concise and helpful. Personally I find this reasonable given the huge demand.  It took 3 months for them to send us the self-return package though, although that has not incur any extra charges.",3.0

16,"This company and this service are a joke for the price they make you pay. It's not acceptable that a capital city like London allows this scam game. I've been with them for almost two years.. initially it was kind of okay, but in the last 6 months their service became completely hopeless. I traveled a lot around the world and I never experienced this amount of outage, not even in remote areas. This time I am without broadband since two weeks, and they kept moving the fixing date (they were probably clueless). Today it was supposed to finally get fixed, but guess what.. nothing. I called and they say that the outage in the area has been resolved, but that an ""engineer"" is needed to reconnect the router (magically). Now the story get even funnier. A serious company, after a serious problem like this, would try to push for accelerating the process, but this scam will send an engineer 4 days from now. It's simply not acceptable. They don't care at all about their customers and their service is the worst ever. Plus, if you don't actively call hundred of times they will not update you at all. Fortunately I will leave this service soon. Dear reader, please be aware!",1.0
17,"Disgusting service. They might be a little bit cheaper than sky but my god if you have a problem. Spent the last 3 days on the phone and waited in for the last 2 for an engineer to come out for nobody to come, the customer service reps just keep lying and setting up another appointment to which nobody even arrives. I will not be going with them again just in case I ever have an issue.",1.0
18,"I know it is a slight cliche to say this but I truly would not give any stars for this review and I encourage anyone thinking of using this service to NOT use Virgin Media. It is the 7th week now we have had no internet service. We have been told that the piping holding the cables has collapsed somehow (???) and they are going to come and lay a new cable. Today was the 5th time we waited for the engineer to turn up and again nobody came. It feels like the Customer Service folk are basically lying or do not know what they are saying. It is often the case when you call Customer Service they pass you around until someone creates a fake date when some fake engineers will turn up. So in essence it is a disaster. Its funny when it was working it was fine but now there is a problem, yep they can not or will not deal with it. Luckily our contract has ended, we just joined Sky, instalation in a week with 400 odd new channels. Yep not as fast as Virgin but whats the use of fast broadband when it doesn't work for weeks on end! Oh and whilst we aee waitinf we get full access to Sky Go the app. So yeah when one door closes etc.  Avoid avoid avoid VIRGIN MEDIA",1.0
19,"Would be zero if I could put it. Absolute worst service provider I have ever dealt with. Had it installed and the 20th September and have not had one week of straight service. Had a whole month of no TV service. My partner has had to miss multiple days of work due to no internet and working from home and it is putting his job at risk, not to mention the financial hit we've had to take for him not getting paid as he is not able to work. I would stay very clear because they have a different issue and excuse every week and 6 weeks in still have an outage every week that takes at least 24 hours for them to sort and 24 hours is on a good day. Absolute horrendous experience.",1.0
20,"My contract was coming to an end, and Virgin wanted to increase my price to Â£38.25 per month. After searching, I found more competitive prices. I called Virgin Media to ask if there was anything that they could do with the price, and they went away and said, there was something they could do with the price........... increase it to Â£46 !!!!!!!!! Needless to say, I went elsewhere.",1.0
21,"If you need your broadband urgently, I warn you to stay away from this provider. Their customer service suck. When they want to sell their service, they are nice, friendly and promise a fast delivery. But you definitely WONâT get the service at the scheduled time. They are not RELIABLE. They have been delaying the set-up of my broadband service for two months and they postponed the appointments 4 times without informing me.  2 months ago, I moved to a new house and immediately called Virgin Media to set up my broadband (As I needed the internet connection urgently which is very critical for my job and their Fiber Line was already available for the new house and they just needed to send their technicians to set up the service) And they have rescheduled the appointment 4 times so fa. Hence after two months I still donât have access to the internet. Last month when they rescheduled the set-upt time for the third time, I was so frustrated and called them more than 10 times to get a proper explanation and nobody gave me one but they apologized and promised to set it up today. However, I noticed they postponed the set-up to the next month again (this is the fourth time) and even they havenât bothered to contact me and inform me. Such a shame. Poor service, poor customer support, and poor technical support. There are better providers and I hardly recommend you to subscribe for another broadband service.",1.0
22,"So when we first signed up to virgin your delivery company Yodl weâre absolutely useless and we kept failing to deliver. We couldnât contact them directly and repeated calls to Virgin Customer service proved futile in resolving the matter. This heavily affected our work from home commitments and caused much stress. Eventually I changed the address and we finally received the hub 2-3 weeks late. Then we had a complaint in august and were credited a one-off resolution credit of Â£24 that was never applied. Then I used their customer services three times to resolve it to no avail. 2 phone calls also proved futile. Then I told the customer service agent I will cancel my direct debit as the credit we had been promised (which they said they would send) would cover our last bill. The credit, of course, never arrived. Then we received a late payment charge which is just beyond frustrating and the audacity is unbelievable.  Then I tried to cancel the contract and they point blank kept refusing,Ignoring me and offering me different tariffs.  I have never experienced such horrific customer services from any company ever.  Avoid at all costs Update 30.10.22 - : Virgin Media have now cut us off, despite in our last conversation saying they will resolve the matter and I will receive email confirmation of the resolution. Of course, no email came. If you're looking for a broadband provider, I implore you, do not choose Virgin Media. You will regret it",2.0
23,DO NOT BE FOOLED BY Virgin Media . I have been a loyal customer for years yet they fail to do what they say. I am still awaiting a manager to call me back 3 weeks later nothing! Spoken to a million advisors yet nothing has been resolved! I was promised i would pay Â£44 yet being charged Â£72! What a bloody joke! Just scammers thats what these guys are! Unprofessionals who just want ur money!,2.0
24,"If you value your own time and sanity you will avoid virgin at all costs. I cannot begin to explain the awful experience that I have had with them... The customer service is the worst I have seen. Something as simple as cancelling my services because I moved house ended up with a default on my credit score and lost me the sale of a property. That is a very simple overview of what happened, but I have wasted 6 months of my life trying to sort something so simple and you just get passed from team to team, because apparently none of them are the ""Right team"" to cancel a service. AVOID They have yet again threatened me with charges and are holding me to ransom because they haven't collected their kit... which has been arranged 4 times.",1.0
25,"My personal advice is to stay away from Virgin at all costs. The customer service is so appalling and will drive you to despair. Trust me as well, you will need to call them at some point.We were due to move home as our contract was running out, so I spoke with Virgin, and they were very kind to offer me a temporary 3-month extension on my Wi-Fi. I rang yesterday to now cancel my contract as I am within the 60 days of the end, and they are denying that 3 months exists, and I would have to pay for 18 months.  This despite it clearly showing on my records. They are claiming that I was promised it, but it is not legitimate. Irony is I am not surprised. If you wish to keep your sanity stay away from this company.",2.0
26,"Not even worth 1 star to be honest. Iâm a new customer (1month in) and Iâve been without a phone line, broadband or tv for three days now. Incredibly difficult to get through to a customer service operative and when you finally do, you are fobbed off and/or cut off. The worst customer service experience Iâve ever had. Problem is still not resolved. Do not sign up to Virgin Media, itâs a total waste of money and time. Iâve had BT, Sky and TalkTalk in the past and they were all far superior. Really regret signing a contract with Virgin.",2.0
27,"I'm beginning to believe this is somehow personal, otherwise this shows how really incompetent virgin media is. The moment we left our previous supplier and went with virgin media we have been having issues. The issue started with the lines somehow being crossed, therefore whenever my phone rang so did my neighbours and vice versa which meant we were privy to each others conversations. I should have cancelled immediately.  I live in a small flat, with an average wall separating the area from my broadband box. For years I struggled to get adequate network in my bedroom which would be 12 feet at the most if I could walk through the walls. Countless phone calls and it was still the same. I still stayed! During the Covid lockdown and just as it was easing I wanted to have access to local news etc as I was only watching catch ups... I called virgin and settled on a plan for broadband, telephone and virgin media, with promises that the broadband strength would increase, needless to say I still had the same issues. In addition for whatever reason at the time virgin media was not connected.  Virgin continued with the same plan, collecting the same amount despite not setting up virgin media. I don't know why I persisted with virgin but I did. Recently I've had enough and decided that they're either gonna do better or I'm gonna switch. They gave me hell to get my number, a number which does not belong to them as I moved over to them with my number from my previous supplier. In any event, that number is used as a business number so we cannot just let it go. After all the trouble and stress of the process we relented again and decided to stay as it was creating so many issues and anxiety. We again agreed on a plan for virgin media again, broadband and telephone. While the network has improved my telephone has stopped working. About two weeks ago an engineer was scheduled to do the TV, but claimed he could not because he wasn't sure he could do a good enough job of not having wires everywhere. We were then offered a streaming box. That would work without wire connection, but that would mean one box when the agreement was to have two boxes installed. I requested another engineer come out as the other one really didn't seem to walk to take the work on. The agreed time was for 9am a few days later. 9am came and went, it was not until about 4pm after multiple phone calls that the engineer came, while i stayed home from work to accommodate that visit. We had a run through of the property, came up with a plan that was suitable and was promised a call to arrange installation. It's been over a week and I'm still waiting for that phone call!!! Virgin is gonna send me a bill for over Â£115 when I have no phone and definitely no tv!!!! An engineer was meant to visit today at 4pm to fix the phone line and should I say I'm still waiting, or is it safe to go ahead and stop waiting? I'm also still waiting for a senior personnel to give me a ring. I contacted virgin WhatsApp chat and as I type I'm still waiting almost two hours to be connected to an agent. Is it that I'm too patient, gullible, stupid or all of the above.  Virgin media you are the worst company I've had the misfortune of letting into our home!",1.0
28,Vey bad company!! Please stay away from them! Today is another day i cannot work from home because they couldnt sort it out their broadband issue inmy area since July!!! 4 months! They have also rubbish customer service. Paying Â£65 per month and cannot get any service from them!,1.0

30,"Virgin broadband or virgin media have to be one of the worst service providers in the UK. Yeah they provide fast Internet but if it works less than half the time what the point? Their customer service is even worse, you make a complaint and they don't contact you back and just close the complaint and mark it as resolved. If a company is taking your money and not providing the service in return, surely this is a Scam?!  Go with anyone else, or just get two cups and a peice of string if you need something reliable.",2.0
31,I rate the service 0. This is the worst customer service I have experienced. It was a simple issue that we needed resolving due to them taking wires out without our consent. Then they we have to wait 2 weeks for this to be rectified. We got placed on long holds or the advisor would be silent for minutes on end. Got passed to complaints to just be hung up on before speaking to anyone and constant service from everyone was appalling. Glad we ended up not going with this provider.,2.0
32,"I signed up for broadband and TV in August.  Already facing problems. No TV and broadband since Fri. My daughter have gcse and my other daughter works from home. When called they said it can be 30 days. When called customer services, they said nothing we can do. Except wait for engineer.i wish I had never signed up to virgin. I had never gone without Internet or TV with bt and sky. Big mistake and bog blunder.  I wouldn't even give one star",1.0
33,Virgin Media has become dreadful and it's customer service is appalling.,1.0
34,"We secured a good deal with Virgin media for broadband in 2020. As soon as our contract ended (June 2022) they hiked our prices up by almost 100%. I called to explain that it was unaffordable, I'd also been made redundant and financially we were struggling. The rep at Virgin was completely uninterested and offered a ""take it or leave"" amount that still resembled an 80% increase on our original tariff. I therefore chose to switch service providers which we did, then called Virgin to cancel and they made it as difficult as humanly possible to do this - the women in the cancellations department actually argued that it was our fault for not being more proactive in reviewing our contract pricing. Another sign we had made the right choice by leaving. I then received multiple calls each day over a week from Virgin sales reps offering prices better than our original package, must've been shy on sales targets but nowhere to be seen when I reached out... Obviously by this point we're already with a new provider so it wasn't possible. They then issued an outstanding payment notice claiming we had to give 30 days notice to cancel and slapped a ""late payment fee"" on top of the value of the unjustifiably hiked tariff. Despite being out of contract. This is the corporate equivalent of bullying - Virgin see us as consumers, not people. Numbers not individuals. The value of the outstanding amount means nothing to Virgin Media, but might mean something to an individual. Do they care? Absolutely not. They are only interested in your pockets so just be wary if you go with them. My advice would be not to following what's been a pretty inhumane and disgraceful experience. Judging by their score here, it's pretty consistent too. Too busy building ""rockets"". What a joke.",1.0
35,"Worst company I have ever deal with. I signed up to a contract which offer an introductory discount. After I had placed my order, virgin media did not honour the discount. I complained multiple times and these emails contained cut and paste responses, but nothing helpful. They said they were unable to find anything which confirmed the offer on their end and after sending them a copy of the contract they had sent to me, they ignored my emails. In addition, they repeatedly got my name wrong in the replies on webchat and some emails. I asked for a letter of deadlock which was ignored and I asked them to cancel my services which they also ignored. Luckily I have now managed to cancel my contract via a telephone call which was also unnecessarily complicated but I have learnt my lesson. Do not go with the cheapest company, they are cheap for a reason. It is worth it to pay a bit extra to get good customer service. I am also in the process of complaining to CISAS as virgin media are knowingly falsely advertising their products.",2.0

37,"Absolutely shocking, I have in the middle of my contract with Virgin and can't wait for it to end.  I run 3 devices, my phone, firestick and laptop.  I can't watch anything on firestick for longer than 10 minutes without buffering, my laptop constantly loses network connection and I can't view my cameras on my phone because of the signal.I reboot router around 5 times a day and still get buffering.  I've had countless engineers out and still rubbish. Last call was this morning, buffering, their solution, pay another Â£8 a month on top of the Â£30 I already get to get a WiFi booster, no thanks.

There's no way to cancel without talking to someone. The service is unreliable, cutting out several times in the last year. I also have concerns about their security.

42,"Honestly not sure how to describe this broadband without many not permitted words but will try.  Customer service- donât care and take 30 minutes to answer every callBroadband - never near recommended speed and always intermittent Other - big brown box on outside of the wall, great attraction for kids to come and kick apart, which happened several times Thatâs the basics but in more detail, they once turned my internet off for 3 days, it wasnât a fault, they turned it off and no one ever could explain why.  They setup the account in the wrong name, but wouldnât change it as they would only speak to the account holder who didnât exist, eventually someone saw sense and sorted it out but took 4 calls (again min 30 minute hold time each call).  Advertised speed 50-70GB, but regularly delivering under 5, customer service excuse was using a device on Wi-Fi. As a comparison I only have wifi connections now using EE and always get at least 70GB download speed.  They increased my bill from what was agreed, within the contract which again took another 30 min hold to sort with someone who again didnât care and I had to provide proof of the original agreement.  I can honestly say Iâve never dealt with anything or any company this bad for anything ever.",2.0

48,"2.5 weeks ago I called to rejoin with virgin media in my new address. I made a 18 month contract for broadband and I have been told Iâll receive my installation plug in box on Tuesday 20/09/2022.I have been told that the property has been provided with fiber before so there will be all the available plugs to connect your broadband and start using your services. A week after I get a call from one of the providers trying to offer me virgin media packages. After I informed the customer service that I already have an ongoing order place and that my box is late for delivery he informed me that there is no order under this name. I provided my account details and I sent my contract so he can check and he can verify that the account exist in the order is there. Eventually he found the order and he apologized as the person I spoke before forgot to do the credit check so the order never been through. I never got an email that the order is not been through or is cancel I just had a contract in my email saying that the delivery is going to be on that Tuesday. He informed me then that this order has to be canceled and a new order has to be placed so after providing all my details again a new your order was placed. They told me cause the offer I booked wasnât available anymore and I should book a new deal which was 5 pounds extra monthly. I told him that didnât want to continue so they offer me the package I had before. After the order was gone through I check the contract and they set the wrong delivery address after I specifically specified that I would like my box to be delivered to a different address. After calling again I managed to change the delivery address and I finally received the installation box. However the installation box doesnât include the appropriate plugs to connect the broadband and the technician has to come to sort my broadband connection. I asked when can this happen and the only available slot for the technician is next week on Thursday 06/10 for which I have to take a day off from work so I can be home . I really cannot understand the whole process and how unprofessional and Company like this can be. I asked for the technician to be around this week but they told me that it has to be booked end it takes a week.

Sadly my mum died last year which I informed virgin media of and they allowed me to continue paying the bill on her account. I got tired of paying this expensive bill and cancelled the account. They came to pick up their broadband box and said I would get a refund of what was owed to me in the next couple of weeks. I then received a cheque in my mumâs name. I called virgin media to ask them to put the cheque in my name as my mum has been dead for over a year and they tell me I need power of attorney. Unfortunately I couldnât get this before my mum died, so someone named Ren in customer service says thereâs nothing she can do.How am I supposed to get power of attorney for a dead person! Virgin media have been perfectly happy taking my money for the last year even though theyâve known the account holder has been dead. All Iâve asked for is for the cheque to be made out to me and theyâve said they canât do that.How can I pay for an account, cancel an account, talk to customer service about an account but they canât change the name on a cheque? I also donât understand why no one informed me to change the name on my mumâs account until after the account has been cancelled??Iâve paid them over a grand in the last year and this is not how you treat a customer of over 10Years.

58,"It should be as easy to unsubscribe from a service as it is to sign up. Other than powerful brand bullies, who is against this? I gladly signed up with Virgin Media for an eighteen month broadband contract in March 2021. The process was rapid, the price very competitive (until my deal ended, when it became absurdly UN-competitive, but I knew that going in) and the service good. When fibre broadband was installed in my area there was no way Virgin or any other traditional provider would be able to compete, so, playing along with the unnecessarily restrictive rules about their timing of cancellations (read the small print) I took an afternoon off to unsubscribe (thanks to feedback I was prepared). Cancelling requires a seemingly inescapable charade of aggressive renegotiation (just offer me your best price upfront please, we don't live in some medieval bazaar). I was then hassled for weeks with ""better"" offers at all hours of the day from a variety of different phone numbers, making it difficult to block. For reasons known only to Virgin, my service was cancelled four days before my contract ended and I was, ludicrously, billed a few pounds for an early disconnection charge. Because the company had proved so inconvenient to negotiate with regarding cancellation, I paid it, which is presumably their bad faith strategy. Then, I was almost immediately threatened with further billing despite returning my Virgin Media equipment within 24 hours of receiving their packaging (now resolved, but we'll see). I kept transcripts of exchanges, and am advising other existing customers to do the same, as the culture demonstrated suggests they are not to be trusted. I can't imagine what it would be like dealing with Virgin Media in case of bereavement or other personal crisis. If anyone from Virgin ever reads this, please know: It is unlikely that making it extremely inconvenient to turn off the service is going to dissuade someone from doing it. It hurts a once respected brand, will demotivate your employees and destroys loyalty. It is short term-thinking and depressingly lazy. But you do it anyway. Just look at the reviews amassing on Trustpilot. When organizations get too big and too short-term focused to pay attention to the market, itâs a perfect moment for consumers to band together and give them a guardrail. If I can sign up with a few clicks, I should be able to withdraw my custom with a few clicks. I rent my London flat, so when I move I may not have fibre broadband as an option, and will likely require another provider. It won't be Virgin Media, and a once loyal customer will now repeat this complaint across any platforms that allow me to leave a review. Pity.",4.0

They use this opportunity to get me to add just a couple of pounds a month onto the contract as a lesser evil to the massive price hike. They then do the same at the end of the contract but they almost double the price so that they can add an extra fiver. These conversations are the most stress inducing conversations I have ever encountered with any company, they are horrendous. I have mental health problems almost every time I hear from this company as it is almost always an argument to get my prices lowered. I honestly can't express how horrible this company is, they are manipulative and use dirty tactics to steal from the consumer. I just got off my final call with them and I have terminated my contract (As they wanted to add Â£10 to my monthly contract and wouldn't budge). I was told by the nice sounding geordie on the other end of the phone that the company has to make profits and that they will always raise the price of your contract. I pointed out the record profits of virgin media and asked why these weren't passed onto the consumer, he said that is just how companies work. I do not want to be part of an organisation that makes record profits and still charge their consumer more money based on the cost of living going up.

79,"Disappointing Braodband and even bigger disappointment with regards to customer service. I have been a Virgin Media broadband customer for three years previously in a different city and it was great. No problems at all. Unfortunately in Brighton the Broadband was awful and when I reported the slow speeds and the constant cutting out I was made to feel very small and incompetent. Virgin Media were not interested in the slightest and just kept saying that their end said there werenât any issues. They eventually sent out an engineer who also didnât resolve anything and just told us we were at the end of the line. To finish it off when my contract was up  Virgin wanted a Â£40 early disconnection fee as my tenancy was for a month less than my Broadband contract. I decided to just pay the 12 months despite no longer being at the property. I was then contacted asking if I would terminate the contract early as someone else was moving into the property but I declined to pay the early disconnection fee. The person was quite insistent despite me making it obvious that their timing was most inconvenient and I asked if they could ring back at a more convenient time. They didnât ring again that evening as requested. I then rang them back to clarify what was going on and again I was asked if I wanted to pay the early disconnection fee, yet again I declined their kind offer to pay more money for a service I was no longer using. Then out if the blue I received a final bill saying that my contract had been terminated without any consultation with myself. When I queried the bill I was told by the young man, I wonât name him as itâs probably not allowed, that Virgin Media could basically do whatever they liked with the contract or words to that effect and when I queried this statement he reneged and denied saying it, although sounding a little flustered. So disappointed this year with the poor service received after three previous contracts that went without any hitches at all.

Unhappy with this, I told them I would find an alternative provider which I did. Despite various phone calls to Virgin and discussions with them via Twitter, they failed to tell me I had to give 30 days cancellation until I called today to tell them I am now with Talk Talk and this is despite not even being in a contract. They basically told me it was my own fault for not being aware of the T&C's and not reading their cancellation policy. So now they intend to charge me for broadband I won't be using for the next month as its been disconnected when I moved to Talk Talk. Had they informed me of this when I first told them I was leaving, I could have cancelled 3 weeks ago.Disgusting company, appalling customer service and clearly have no value for customers.

Virgin did not instal the service on 20/06, instead rescheduled the instal to 01/07 and again failed to install the services on 01/07 without any communication or warning. I contacted Virgin numerous times asking for help as my Broadband contract expired on 30/06 and had no help offered so we purchased a dongle as we both work from home. I worked from friends' places and my wife worked off the dongle. I contacted them numerous times to speak to a senior manager and lodge a complaint with no success. As a consequence, I contacted EE on 04/07following my struggle of two months with Virgin and had every date met from kit delivery to BB installation. So in less then 12 days from the order I had a service provide which Virgin was uncapable of delivering in two months+. After the failed installation on 01/07. I contacted virgin numerous times and was given the 4th for cable instal with service activation to follow which was then pushed out to 08/07, then on the 8th, since nobody turned up I was given no further dates, just a plain statement that it will happen before 18/07 as the service will be activated on 18/07. Coincidentally a team turned up today to install the cable to the property, but I have today 14/07 cancelled the installation as I have lost confidence in their customer service, do not want to have the continued stress and uncertainty.

185,"I would happily give zero stars, in every way for everything.My late mother had virgin and she unfortunately passed away in December. I call to notify them in January and was given two options. Either carry on with her existing contract OR become a âNew Customerâ. As she was a long standing customer she managed to secure a very good package deal. So I agreed to continue under those terms and gave over my bank details. However it has been anything but a smooth ride.Having to make contact, on average; monthly, as the direct debit amount was not correct and/or services not working.This came to ahead in March 22 when I received a bill for double the agreed amount. I called and was informed that the amount to be debited from my account was not that amount, this was showing as they had not made a manual credit adjustment in time.Direct debit date comes around and they take that larger amount. I called again and demanded my money back. I was directed to make an Indemnity claim at the bank, which I did.Then in April I received a bill with an even larger balance.I was persuaded by a virgin media sales rep that all my problems would go away if I took out a new package as I wasnât actually on a contract - which incurs a charge, there was no direct debit set up - which incurs another fee. So I set up as a new customer and there was a very detailed conversation about amounts to be paid and credits and account closures.Suffice to say I sought another provider and had them come and install actual fibre to my property, not a glorified broadband speed. To then be told that itâs virgins standard procedure to charge a month in advance. This was never outlined to me at all during an hours telephone conversation.So I called to close everything down. And even though Iâm not in contract, or at this point, even using their service (every virgin piece of equipment was unplugged and set to the side) and that I would need to arrange for their equipment to be sent back or they are going to charge me Â£65.00.Cut to now. Having spent 36 hours in their chat queue and it is only now that o have managed to get a complaint officially raised.I am now left with a motorways length of cable at my house which is draped through my guttering, stuffed under hedges and worse - a tripping hazard as pointed out by the new providers independent regional installation team. No wonder the service was so shoddy it was never installed properly. I will never have any Virgin Media product in my house again. And now they have merged with O2 - with whom my family have been loyal customers for years. We are also in the process of switching all mobile contracts and services to another provider. I will now actively discourage people to sign up with virgin media and I will leave negative reviews at any given opportunity so that people are aware just how this disgraceful and inept this organisation is.BEWARE of virgin media. They are quick to take your money and make their demand for it.

There are three downsides to virgin however.  1.Price hikes - these happen yearly and are always at inflation + an extra percentage.  Inflation I can acept, but the added percentage is a rip off.   2. Supplied Router - The superhub 3 or the more modern 4 are dire. They need regular rebooting (which takes about 5 mins to complete) and the wifi coverage is terrible. If you choose to go with virgin, an aftermarket router is a must (a huawei ax3 costs aboutr Â£30 and massivly improves performance).   3. Customer service is terrible.  Most agents seem to be based in Asia and comminicating with them is hard, and they seem only to be trained to follow a script.

229,"Absolutely appalling customer service from Virgin Media. We've had their broadband service for a few years then contacted them a week before we exchanged contracts for our recent move. The person we spoke with told us we could take our existing Virgin Hub with us to our new home, and the next day after the move plug it in and our service will continue.  This turned out to be a lie. It didn't work so we spent an hour waiting to get hold of someone and when we did they stated that we were given incorrect information and that we needed an engineer to visit and install for us.  So, we decided to cancel our contract and return our hub... we've endured patchy customer service over the years from Virgin Media and thought we'd take the opportunity to go with BT instead. Contract cancellation was confirmed on the phone with Virgin Media and we also then cancelled our Direct Debit. A few weeks later, they send us a new hub, which we put to one side thinking they'll then twig they didn't need to send it then ask us to send it back. They're so disjointed as a business that it's still sitting in our dining room awaiting collection. But the sting for us is that a few months later we receive a debt agency collection communication that we owe Virgin Media moneyâ¦ which we don't as we cancelled and it was confirmed on the phone by a Virgin agent. We've now spent a few hours over the last fortnight calling and communicating with Virgin, asking them to listen to the phone recordings, and then cancel this debt that we don't owe. Eventually, we speak with someone who states that we did owe for a disconnection notice and we agreed we'd pay it. It was Â£61. We've now been presented with a bill for Â£82, more than the amount agreed. It's just insane. We're both self-employed so spending more time chasing Virgin is time we could be spending on billable activity for our business. So, what do we do? Pay it and put it down to experience? Just leave it, and see if the Debt Collection Agency comes back again? I've never experienced anything like this and I'm hoping that someone senior in Virgin Media will see this and other posts and actually initiate some change within the organisation. Each department is like a silo, operating independently of other departments. Why they can't get aligned and actually offer a joined-up customer service is ironic, given they're in the communications sector. I never want to use Virgin Media again and indeed it puts me off potentially using other Virgin branded services.

They failed to give me 30 days notice (legal requirement) that the fees would increase from Â£27 per month to Â£51.

They told me there wouldn't be so I signed up with another provider and rang back 5 days later to cancel my virgin account.

Called them to find out that they know nothing about changed date and didn.t care that I could send them screenshots as evidence. They insisted on their date. I was off sick so I thought, whatever, I can wait. On the day engineer arrived at the very last minute of agreed time and said he wont be able to install the line as he knows that there is no one around to give him access to cupboard with thee internet lines and that he explained it to the head office before to set different time slot. Next day I received text + email informing me that the next available date will be in 2 weeks!!! I decided to call them and that's where hell broke loose. Apparently I supposed to have ""phone password"" to be able to identify myself. I told them that I cant remember setting one. I got internet account, set security question but couldn't remember setting anything for a phone. They were using secondary verification until I had enough and declared that I changed my mind and want to cancel installation/contract. They said I have to call different number which when I called was out of use. Called them again on normal line and they disconnected me 4 times after learning that I want to cancel and don't know my phone password. Called once more and asked how can I reset this password. They replied that its not possible as there is no option for it, not online nor over the phone... I asked then that this mean that I have been put in the limbo and have no way to leave them or even complain as I have no means to contact them, btw, if you try to inform them about leaving online you will end up on error 404 website... They declared that I can request a letter with reminder of my password which I agreed to... 2 weeks ago! My guess is it comes on a donkey from India as that's where their call centres are located. Cherry on the cake was a phone call from them after I replied to text informing me that next day will be my installation day, and declining to it. The guy was trying to set another date after I told him that I do not want it and I'm trying to cancel the whole thing! He couldn't understand what I am saying to him and it really started to feel like I am on the line with one of these scam call centres. I told him to go and find my letter and finished the call.

302,"Doesn't deserve even one star!!!!!!!  I have been with Virgin media for 17 years and have recently moved to my new house in December 2021. The move obviously is always stressful but what has made this worst for me is my decision to move my services with me. Itâs been 6 weeks now and having spent countless hours over phone and having had several visits to property by technicians/surveyors and having spoken to countless people/agents and having paid more money and several cancelled/rescheduled appointments, I am still without Internet and media services till date with no solution in sight!!!!! Not only are there long waits to speak to an agent and frequent call drops but they are also not trained and lack knowledge and there is absolutely no coordination between various teams. Some agents have been insulting and rude. Their lack of knowledge has resulted in me getting false and misleading information and has caused me extreme anxiety and inconvenience. Each agent I have spoken to has given me different information which contradicted the information from previous agent and each one of them say that the previous agent has given wrong information. Majority of the times I was just being transferred from one team to other and would go through security checks 10 times and keep repeating myself every time when transferred to a new agent in a call. This is extremely frustrating and i firmly believe that no customer should go through such an experience! I thought I may have been an exception but reading other reviews posted clearly highlights that the company does not care about customers anymore and wouldn't pay any attention to issues/complaints. I strongly suggest not to consider Virgin media if you do not want to go through torture and harassment. Sharing few of my life experiences (or rather absolute harassment)!!!! There have been several days when I have made 10 calls or more, waited and spent more than 8/9 hours in a day, spoken to more than 15 agents in a day! Logged an official complaint for hassling customers, miscoordination (Internal installation & external installation team/ Movers & Preinstallation team), mis informing customers and appalling customer services 2 weeks ago but have not heard anything back from anyone, not even an acknowledgement! Installation was initially scheduled for 17th Dec but couldn't be carried out as the cable has been pulled up by Construction Unit to a wrong place. Since then, trying to rectify the simple issue as above has been more difficult than reaching Mars! One of the calls to report this issue- the Agent promptly cancelled the order and hung the phone without any proper discussions The installation was moved to 12th Jan (earliest) which meant no services in our new home for 3 weeks specially during holidays! One of the agents said that mobile dongle would be provided free to ensure we have internet during Xmas and asked me to speak to Mobile team which was an absolute nightmare as all agents subsequently refuted each other and told me to buy it! Another agent when followed up in December (20-24th Dec) said that the external team has gone again and fixed the issue that morning, but this was untrue as the issue was still unresolved. Not sure why these agents are forced to lie perhaps to placate or get rid of the call soon!? To summarise, there is an issue with how External installation team has left the cable and all the calls I have made and countless hours I have spent since then is to get this corrected because the internal installation team would not be able to do anything until this is fixed and I will keep experiencing this pain until then and would not have any services too!!!ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE!!!! Hope someone, somewhere in the system takes a note of how far the customer services have deteriorated and how much pain it is causing the customers but, in the interim, would strongly suggest everyone to consider Virgin Media only if you are not left with any other option!!!!!",2.0

I even requested another router which was refused. So unable to use the service as you didn't supply hardware I spent HOURS and I have proof trying to sort this mess out with you17:11, Jan 6 You: I couldn't use a service without the hardware so why would I stay with a provider that cannot provide?17:29, Jan 6 You: here I am again over 90 mins repeating myself and getting nowhere17:29, Jan 6 Meena: I am sorry to know about the hassle which you have come across Alistair, I feel really bad after going through all these and you have been so patient so far. Dont worry I will see what best can be done for you.

I have tried my best Alistair, but unfortunately we cannot waive off the charges as you have been able to use the services and itcould have been resolved alternatively. But as you have cancelled it between contract, you was been charged with disconnection fee Alistair.17:46, Jan 6 You: Did you not read the information i poasted??17:52, Jan 6 Meena: Okay where you not informed that you will be charged termination fee if you are cancelling the contract Alistair?18:00, Jan 6 Meena: Alistair, we booked for the second time and you never waited for the delivery to be sent, you immediately put a request for disconnection Alistair. Please understand this charges cannot be removed as itsvalid from our end.18:03, Jan 6 You: no, i made contact with VM as you had not even bothetred to disptach the second one.

I tried to do this using the online system but it did not support cancellation. I tried using the online chat function but they kept me waiting until I lost the will to live. I emailed Virgin who insisted that I phone their retention team. I tried to phone the retention team and sat in a phone queue until my patience was exhausted. I lodged a complaint through the Virgin Complaints process and asked to be contacted by email. Virgin phoned me while I was driving and left a message asking me to call them. I tried and sat in another phone queue for a while. I kept emailing with no success so took the case to CEDR (meanwhile, Virgin were still debiting the monthly bills for as service that I was not receiving). I received an offer from Virgin as follows:- ""Â£250.00 compensation, as a gesture of goodwill....Cancel your services free of charge. Once again, please accept my apologies for the inconvenience caused as a result of the delay in cancelling your services"". It was now 29/7/21 so I reluctantly accepted expecting the money to be credited to my account. Nothing happened so I followed up and Virgin told me that it was company policy to only offer refunds by cheque. I eventually received a cheque for Â£250 but Virgin were still debiting my account Â£25.85 per month. I received approximately 10 calls from the Virgin Retention team asking if there was anything they could do to retain my business. My account was cancelled in Sept but my money was not refunded and Virgin does not accept complaints from cancelled accounts so I went back to CEDR and raised a further complaint. Virgin challenged this under CEDR terms and conditions saying that a complaint cannot be accepted if it relates to a previous complaint. I responded saying that Virgin had failed to properly deal with the previous complaint but CEDR upheld Virgin's position. I shall also be lodging a complaint against CEDR.",1.0

362,"The standard of customer service that I have recently received from Virgin Media ranks among the worst experiences I have ever endured when dealing with any business. I made contact to arrange a home move, aware of the fact that there were likely to be complications as I would be staying with friends temporarily whilst between addresses.  I was informed within this conversation that there was no mechanism within Virgin Media's contracts to pause in such an event, despite this being a very commonplace occurrence. As the contract could not be transferred to my temporary accommodation, I was informed that it would be terminated as soon as new residents commenced a contract at my previous address.  As I had no desire to end this contract and had every intention of transferring it to my new permanent address or recommencing at the new address, I requested that the termination fee be waived. I was told bluntly that this was not an option and that no level of management would have the authority to waive the fee.  I have spoken to multiple members of the home move and customer service team but have been unable to speak to a manager at any point. I was promised a call back from a manager at 9am the following day. This never materialised.  When I called back to request the promised conversation with a manager, I was informed that a manager had tried to call at 9.40am. This was absolutely untrue. After multiple conversations with further members of customer service staff, I was informed that the aforementioned manager would try to call again and that another manager would ring me back within 72 hours.  These calls have again not occurred one week later.  My account has been terminated with no written notice, I found this out only because I logged into my online Virgin Media portal to find that my account had been closed. My Virgin Mobile account, which was directly associated with my Virgin Media account, stills works, but I have been given no information about the terms and conditions of this ongoing service.  All in all, this has been an appalling experience as a customer, leaving me to pay a significant fee despite having actively sought to remain with Virgin Media.

They frequently lie about their services: if you download the app it promises to ""optimise"" the wifi for you to eliminate blackspots. This makes absolutely no difference to your actual connection, and yet they still claim to have improved it every single time.

After a while we literally had to call them every month as they kept trying to up our direct debit without letting us know. Some months it would go from Â£50 to Â£85!

We were quoted Â£147 to be able to cancel and leave them, we wanted to pay it over the phone but we couldnât and had to wait for it to be taken out of the bank account by them. I have unplugged the tv box and turned the WiFi router and phone off just so that we knew there wouldnât be any additional charges made up by them.

That was the moment i decided i need to quit their service but surprise surprise, i need to pay an early disconnection fee of 150GBP. So they cause me the problem, they force me to quit their service and they want to charge me an early disconnection fee. This is the real hustle.

477,"Where to begin? (Clue - dont even think about signing up. Move on, find a different provider). The below letter, should give you an idea of our nightmare. (Despite my complaint being logged they threatened us with court action if we didnt pay the withheld Â£167 cancelation fee. Not wanting a bad credit reference we gave in to their bullying tactics to be free of them  and peace of mind. Deplorable treatment of ""customers"". Account no: xxxxxxxx Regarding the above account number at the address of xxxxxx Road, EN5 xxx. From your letter dated 12 Feb I see that we have been charged Â£167.92 cancelation fee.Let me explain why we will not be paying this.The service provided by Virgin Media has been not fit for purpose. We both work from home. Both of us found that our laptops kept disconnecting from the wifi, our Teams and Zoom calls kept dropping. This was embarrassing and unacceptable, not to mention we both lost work we had spent a lot of time on.  We called many times, to lodge complaints and try and get Virgin to do something about it. However, after listening to answering machine messages and dreadful muzak for hours we were usually cut off, or, if someone did answer, then they said they would put us through to someone else, and then we were cut off! As you can imagine, having an internet service that keeps cutting you off is one thing, but when the service provider keeps cutting you off as well, when you try and speak to them, well, thatâs the final straw. So over many months we probably spent a small fortune on phone calls, and got through only once I believe to lodge a complaint. We had an engineer round who did nothing else than apologise but the service did not improve, although once I did manage to remain on a video call for almost 25 minutes before I was disconnected.Very frustrating, when the service you pay for doesnât work and the service provider is not available to listen to your issues. So nothing changed. In the end, both myself and my wife, bought, at our own expense, data packages for both our mobile phones, and used these to connect our laptops to in order to be able to work from home. So as you can see, the service provided by Virgin, such that it was, was not fit for the purpose that we intended it for. Secondly, we had little ability to make contact with the service provider to raise the issue. When we did manage to get through, nothing was done. We have had to pay a second service provider to provide the service that we were already paying Virgin to provide.  I believe we were in fact miss-sold this broadband service by Virgin as the quality was clearly not good enough for daily use and its intended purpose. Therefore, we will not be paying your cancellation fee, and are considering notifying trading standards to recover further costs we have paid to Virgin for a service that we were miss-sold, that was not usable as intended and that Virgin did nothing to remedy. We are now with BT and have no issues at all. Moreover, when we call them, someone actually answers the phone.  Regards,  Lukas Tatek.",1.0
478,Terrible customer service. OK until something goes wrong and you're left waiting on a call or online chat for hours with no resolution. In my experience their advice is contradictory as i was told one thing and then after being on a call for over 2 hours was told something completely different. Completely unhelpful and a huge waste of time. Submitting a complaint about begin kept waiting for hours at a time also gets you nowhere as their only resolution they offer is that internal feedback will be provided. Infuriating is an understatement. Avoid at all costs!,2.0

482,"The customer service at Virgin media has been the worst experience of my entire life. They give you false promises and never deliver! I was moving home and called the 1 month in advance to tell them if I can take my Virgin media to my new home. Here the caller gave me the first bit of false home and told me they will send out a spotter who will contact me in 5 days to tell me if they can supply Virgin media in that area or not. The caller also confidently said that I can take my Virgin media with me and therefore I shouldn't sort out another internet provider. 2 weeks go by and I haven't heard anything so I call back. Here I get the second bit of false hope as they firstly acknowledge that the spotter still has not come out so they told me they will send another one out and should be contacted in 5 days. It has now been a 6 weeks with no contact since my initial call and I am left without internet at my new property. Now, another beautiful problem with Virgin media is there cancellation fee. I want to take Virgin media with me but after speaking to them on the phone they tell me I cannot get Virgin media at my place. Clearly this is due to their spotters not contacting anyone. Nevertheless, to know fault of my own, I want to take my services to my new location however they are the ones failing to provide the services. But guess what? I am the one who has to pay Â£162 in cancellation fees! Whoopee for me. So I don't get any internet at my new accommodation with 6 weeks notice to them and get a hefty fee along with it as they are unable to provide me service. All the meanwhile I have spoken to 6 different callers all with zero empathy. One caller also even left me on hold for 30 minutes before disconnectinh me and never to hear back from again. The Â£160 loss is heavy for me as I am a student. However, the thousands they will lose from me as a future customer and my friends and familys is a bigger loss to them.

484,"Never AgainToday I cancelled my contract and opted to pay the cancellation fee due to the absolutely awful WiFi connection. This, only after about 3 months with Virgin Media. Speeds have been as low as 1.00 mbps download with 0.03 mbps upload anywhere in the house except in the room in which the media box is located (just retested and 5.51 mbps download and 0.07 mbps upload). This, the advisors at Virgin Media (Virgin) say, is what Virgin are contracted to provide and are therefore fulfilling their part of the contract. The only guarantee Virgin provide for full speed, in my case 108 mbps download and 10 mbps upload, is if a device is connected using a ethernet cable. How archaic is this? No apologies provided by the advisors to whom I spoke, just a reiteration of the fact the contract is being met and a suggestion to purchase a booster for each room. Yes, boosters would have been cheaper than cancellation, but on principle the situation is unacceptable and not fair treatment for the customer. I did not have guaranteed WiFi in each room with my previous provider BT, in fact I only had download speeds of 14 mpbs, but yet I was able to comfortably attend virtual meetings, stream Netflix, YouTube and other services with limited interruption. If Virgin's speeds were comparable to what I was getting from BT, I would have been frustrated but sucked it up. How anywhere near 1.00 mbps could be acceptable however and brushed off with a suggestion to pay an additional monthly charge for boosters is just unfathomable. How is this company regulated? How do they get away with treating customers in this way? It's easy to explain contractual terms but surely this must be measured against providing the best service possible to customers. Unfortunately, nothing about this service has been good. I never write a review but this is one I will shout from the mountain top to anyone who will listen.

I signed up for 200mbps and I can only get this in the room where the router is - virtually nothing upstairs when it has always been fine before - I was sent a booster which you have to pay extra for when this service is not fit for purpose and other providers give these free.

He said he would restore it, but then simply left without fixing it. Result: from 16h Monday to now we've had no internet.

So all this time, no internet, no work - just a borrowed WIFI and our 3gs to do the bare minimum. Already unacceptable. As if it wasn't enough, they didn't show up to their appointment (which I've been waiting since 8am). Instead, they called me once (while I was in the middle of a meeting).

What am I expecting. So I waited 2 further weeks thinking I'll get a letter, an email, phone call or something to say what the delay is for, roughly how long, I heard nothing from them, so I phoned up myself to see what's going on. I explained I purchased on February, for march install, and we're in mid April and I've heard nothing, he explained about road works needed permission to dig up, which I totally agree and knew about, hence why I ordered way in advanced, so he said could I give it until end of April , I said yeah sure no problem  Anyway end of April comes, again, nothing , no text, email , phone, letter.

563,"Firstly, for the actual service, I was with Virgin Media for 2 years. The deal was the most competitively priced for 100mbps speeds. Throughout those two years the internet speeds never felt great, many days I would check the speed and it would be below 10mbps. Virginâs terms and conditions make it difficult to challenge drops in speed. On the 27th March I switched provider to get 67mbps speeds for the same price, and honestly, the service has been far better and consistent. Now to share my story at how awful it has been to move my services. Middle of March 2021, I contact virgin via the web chat to make them aware Iâm moving homes. They tell me they cannot offer 100mbps at the new home, that is fine, I put in a cancelation request. A few days later, I get a call from Virgin telling me I can get those speeds at the new home and they offer me a good deal, I accept and share my details, such as my moving date, the 27th March. 20th March, Virgin Media terminate my existing broadband, 7 days too early. Leaving me to have to purchase and use Data in order to do my job. To get reconnected took 4 hours 14 minutes (14 at least different calls). Why so many calls? I would be reconnected to another department rather often, and just less than half the time, my call would be disconnected while being transferred. This happened roughly a dozen times from start to finish. I was reconnected after 4 days without broadband.  While the team helped me get reconnected, they brought it to my attention that the there is also a problem with the new property I asked to move my broadband to. They have to do some building work to get the broadband up to speed and this would take between 4-8 weeks, they said they would supply me with a dongle in the meantime. They gave me a number I had to text in order to sort out the dongle. I text the number it led to a conclusion that someone would call me within 24 hours to sort out the dongle. No one called. I text the number again, same conclusion someone will get back in touch. No one called. I text the number again, same conclusion someone will get back in touch. While this was going on, I was still phoning virgin to get reconnected, since it was a 4-day ordeal. While trying to get reconnected, I finally threw in the towel and said I donât want any services from Virgin anymore, I would like to leave. The dongle was given up on as well. I went with a new provider EE, who have been great so far.  My final date with Virgin media was the 27th March. I got a letter saying I was owed Â£13 for my services being terminated in late March, since I did pay for the full month right at the start. I raised a complaint and they kindly offered me Â£50 in a goodwill sorta thing for my troubles. This was confirmed in an email on 16/04/2021. Fast forward to 10th May. I had still not received my Credit. Not only that, I was sent a letter that I owe Virgin Â£30ish. Well 5 calls on the 10th, lasting a combined 4 hour 22 minutes consisting of a few disconnections (one disconnection happening 3 hours into a call) I find out that Virgin never cancelled on the 27th March. They were still trying to charge me. And the Credit I was promised was used to reduce these charges on my bills I never received. This has took out some of my credit score success since it appears Iâve been missing some payments I had no idea about. During my 4 Hour 22 Minute worth of calls, I do speak to a lot of customer service reps. Two of which are very helpful. They explain to me why I havenât had my credit, that Iâm still with Virgin apparently. They set me up to have my account cancelled (again) the following day. They tell me they will âremoveâ the charges between the 27th March and 11th May. And I may see my credit on my final bill. So I was expecting a final bill of Â£63 Credit, the Â£50 from good will and the Â£13 owed from March. Nope on 12/05/2021 they still want Â£9 off of me? Despite getting letters of credit from them and myself and the customer reps agreeing that I was mistakenly still with Virgin Media after the 27th? So what are they charging me for? All in all, this is the worst product Iâve paid for. The amount it has cost me in time and effort, when originally this all started just because I told them I was moving and would like to move my services. Itâs ended up in me losing out on Credit Score, Time, Data and Money. Virgin lost a customer who was wanting to stick with them despite some drops in speed, because after all their prices are very good. No oneâs won. My ordeal continues to this day trying to not be charged and trying to get my credit although Iâm less bothered by the Credit at this point.

567,"Donât often leave reviews but I was so shocked in the end by Virginâs customer service that I felt obliged to share my experience here. Couple of things happened, firstly on basics: 1) They are a classic âwait for hours on the phone, finally get through to someone, get put on hold, then get disconnectedâ service and they do NOT bother calling you back. Takes 3-4 attempts to see a basic conversation through2) They DONâT take notes about your calls unless it suits them - so when you call back weeks or months later referring to advice given in a past conversation it very likely wonât have been recorded - the result of which means they will feign ignorance and change advice as it suits them3) Finally upon joining Virgin I was given advice about options that were open to me should I need to cancel my contract early. One of these were the option of transferring to a new owner, which would have meant I would avoid paying early disconnection charges. I spent months setting this up under very specific directions from virgin, only to get to the final day where they then said they didnât support this type of transaction at all (despite earlier detailed guidance from them)4) Finally they donât actually process complaints. They literally file the and close them on the spot (and told me this).  In short, surprisingly horrendous customer service, conflicting advice, poor standards of care including note taking or call backs, and in the end they will do what they please without listening to the customer.

He gave me options of the packages and told me the most suitable one for me which I agreed with. He also stated he would take care of my transition from my previous provider and that I would not need to contact them or pay any cancellations fees. He said to contact him  directly from 9am to 8pm and gave his cell number to me.. A month later not only do I notice he set me up on the wrong package but he had not dealt with my previous provider so I had been slapped with a huge cancellation fee and had to liaise with them for an hour to cancel my contract at no extra cost. I had tried to contact contact Chris during this period numerous times via call and text for more then a week and no response to date. Once I set up the Virgin WiFi which I received on the 17th of April, I had no network. I contacted Virgin on the 21st of April as there was still no network and they said there was a power outage in the Ha1 region and that it would be working by 3pm that day. Mind you the outage had apparently occurred since the 12th of April. Whilst speaking to the person who told me about the outage, I told her to update my package and she said she would connect me to the relevant department but the line got disconnected. There was no call back either so I tried to call the customer service again through their number on the website to update the package and was put on hold for half an hour at which point I got frustrated and hung up. When I called today 23rd April, I got an update stating the service is still down and expected to be fixed by the 26th of April. Seriously like how long does this take?!

This is a stark contrast to other providers who advertise a maximum speed but rarely reach even close to those speeds. I had never had an issue with customer service and their website handled most of what I needed in terms of getting info or changes to my account. BT, for example, has an awful website, badly designed, slow and limited in its functionality. The router provided was also above standard for the industry as it was much more reliable than others on the market and with faster peak speeds. Overall I have no reason to give them less than 5 stars.",2.0
620,"I got a contract for 18months because the price was really good. But in the end, it seems to be more expensive. When I initially started the contract, I asked what would it happen if I cancel before the end on the 18months. They said I could move my services to the new flat or cancel paying a disconnection fee of maximum 50% of the current monies left.  Well, now that it is happening is another story. I have 6 months left. They cannot supply internet where I go (Brighton, odd). And basically they are saying: one month needs to be paid to have the services on until I leave which is understandable. That is Â£23.95. But the following 5 months the disconnection fee is Â£106.38, which is Â£21.27 per month!! Nearly the same I am paying to have the service! On top of that. It is impossible to speak to an agent on the phone. Every time I want to speak to an agent I need to spend 15-20min chatting to a machine, and then depending o the issue an agent would appear, which replies every several minutes. I never receive clear information, so confusing. I have spent literally 1 hours chatting to cancel my services. And I still need to send the router to them to avoid a fine.  Summary.

I have called them today and been told that the complaint is still open and somehow they can not see the deal they offered had been accepted therefore they can not honour the deal. If you can't see any deal achieved why would you keep a complaint open and keep charging a higher amount? Totally unprofessional and unreliable . Stay away !",1.0

624,ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!! Non-existent customer service. One of the hardest companies to leave. Website for complaints is often down. Phoning through for complaints or fixing an issue led to me being hung up on 5 times after waiting over an hour to be connected each time. Virgin would not know competency if it was slap in the face with it. Absolutely tired of this ****** company.,2.0
625,"TLDR; Avoid this company at all costs!If you're unfortunate to be with Virgin already and have technical problems, call 08000527553 to skip the customer service waiting queue nightmare to go to the second line technical team directly (they answer in less than a minute). My personal experienceI've been plagued with issues with their internet since October 2020, and have literally spent 20+ hours, in the month of February alone, over the phone with them to try and explain my problems. We're now in March, I still don't have internet working properly and I can't wait for my contract to expire to move to another provider. Horrendous customer serviceThe customer service is a complete mess: getting someone over the phone is a lot more difficult than it should, probably to deter clients from calling. When I want to speak with someone, I often end up with an automated voice sending me a link on my mobile to ""troubleshoot my broadband connection issue"". Technical nightmareWhen you finally manage to have someone over the line, they force you to go through meaningless troubleshooting (""turn off and on your router"") even though the issue is unrelated, because they do not have the proper technical knowledge (I have a signal SNR issue where the connection is up and down, disconnecting multiple times per day). They've sent a different engineer 5 times at my property: 2 times my isolator was replaced (and nothing else) and 2 times the engineers said the issue was with the network team, not them (one even refused to get out of his car claiming he didn't bring any face mask and only discussed by phone). At some point, I managed to get the second line technical team phone number (08000527553) and avoided discussing with the technical team (150 or 03454541111), which saved time as they only kept asking me to reboot my router to make it work.When the issue is finally raised to the proper team, don't think this will solve anything: this team has closed my fault ticket 7 times (!!) between the 26 January and the 4 March wrongly claiming my problem was fixed, and everytime I had to go through the hassle of re-explaining my issue (when I managed to have someone over the phone) and opening a new fault ticket. Lack of any type of compensation/alternative solutionAlso, be warned that Virgin has a policy to only give you some credit back if you have a total loss of service for more than 72 hours. If you manage to be connected only one hour per day during this period, they will not compensate you in any form: the customer service department tells you their hands are tied and that you need to ask the technical team to raise a compensation request, but the technical team tells you they have no control over the compensation claims anyway because it's an automatic process. I have been using my 3G data non-stop since the 27th of February (we're the 11th of March and it's still not working) to work from home, but my claims are denied (because apparently there may have been internet an hour or so here and here). If like me, you don't have internet at all, don't even bother asking Virgin for some alternative solution (mobile broadband, mobile phone 4G credit, etc...) as they cannot (or won't) help you in any way. Complains are ignoredI've raised several complains but the compliance department doesn't even bother calling you back (even though I'm told they will call back within 5 days over the phone). ""Escalating"" the issue doesn't even make a difference, expect that someone tells you the compliance department will call you back within 48 hours (but they don't).",1.0

Virgin Medea decided that they don't need to pay compensation because they say that  was intermittent lost of internet and would not believe us when we say that it was constant. Its their word against ours. Wait, it gets even better. No we are in March and so far we had 8 consecutive days and counting without internet.

Finally, I sent a letter to their complaints department in Sunderland, citing my complaint, the original reference number, and copies of all correspondence. Royal Mail obtained a signature but still according to Virgin Media I didnât get back in touch! Even yesterday trying once again to resolve this on the phone I spoke to the resolution team who decided to pass me back through to Virgin Mobile an overseas call centre where the staff sound like robots and have absolutely no idea about customer service! So, thanks Virgin Media and thanks to your outbound retention team based in sunny Birmingham for mis-selling. Please donât respond asking me to text you, I think I have made adequate attempts to resolve this and you have failed. As for closing my complaint I have escalated it now to CISAS and the Financial Ombudsman, next stop the ICO for the fact your employee stole my bank details from my Virgin Media account and set up a direct debit with my bank for Virgin Mobile, I misuse of my personal data.

The customer service is absolutely terrible, we have been on around 13 different calls, each with 1 hour wait times and we get bounced back and forth between departments who tell us the same thing over and over. We ordered wifi boosters with 3 DIFFERENT customer service agents. THREE! After the 2 weeks they all said to wait, we didn't receive anything and called up again only to be told no one had ordered anything for us and nothing was on the system even when we registered the boosters to be delivered online ourselves as well.

One time our wifi cut out for 4 days, which was shocking in itself and we had 5 people working and learning from home and Virgin said they canât do anything to fix it. All they said was wait for an engineer to come, when the nearest available appointment was a week later.

I was in a zoom meeting and my son was doing his home learning. We were both kicked out and the wifi disappeared from the list of available networks. I immediately tried to contact Virgin on 150 but was on hold for almost an hour after hearing a less than helpful automated message. I eventually got to speak to someone who asked me to unplug my router and plug it back in again after a few minutes. Didn't work. Tried to call back and couldn't get through. The Network eventually appeared in the list but i couldn't access any web addresses or log into my company's VPN. I've been without internet since and was told the ""estimated"" date and time of completion would be 28th January at 10:20am. I had internet from 8am that morning but 2 hours later, the internet had disappeared again. I've contacted customer services again and asked to leave, if the service i'm paying for isn't fixed by the end of the day. I was informed by the leavers team that the fix in the whole of my area will now be fixed by 3rd February. Unacceptable. Customers are working from home and home schooling their children. Any fix should be resolved as quickly as possible and we should be informed of any issues, rather than us having to spend most of our day on the phone to be told nothing useful. I received a letter a few weeks ago stating that my plan was increasing. If my service was faultless, i'd have no problem paying more for my plan.",2.0
676,Customer service if you have a problem or every 6 months when they put your bill up is dreadful. You will be spending hours of your life on hold. Worst customer service of any of the providers I've been with.,1.0
677,"there is an obvious problem with my broadband and TV package which Virgin, after several conversations with them, are not prepared to resolve.  They claim out of this world broadband speeds but in reality I find them quite slow for what I pay for the service (almost Â£60)",2.0
678,"Virgin Media customer service are non-existent. I spent over 10 hours across three days trying to contact customer service; their customer service line puts one on hold for 60+ minutes, and then disconnects if one has not yet reached an agent (which rarely occurs). When one does finally reach an agent, s/he has no authority to resolve problems; they only transfer to other agents. Agents then refuse to admit problems, and instead threaten customers with legal action for breach of contract when they assert that Virgin Media's services do not work as advertised. Prices change without notice, and customer service agents deny that there is any change even when presented with differing bills for the same service. Reaching any customer service agent at all required 19(!) posts on Virgin Media's Facebook page, in order to finally arrange a Webchat. Virgin Media are dishonest thieves whose have systems designed to waste so much customer time that the customer gives up and pays whatever they ask. One * for customer service is too much. AVOID.",2.0
679,"I'm simply disgusted with the service. Before I had the 50mbps fibre but I was only getting about 8-9mbps and then I had to pay more to upgrade to the 10mbps package. They did nothing attheor end to try fix my service. Their get out jail card is based on you getting 'UP TO' 50mbps. Luckliy by street fibre optics were recently upgraded by the council so I do get more speed now. However, my router needs to be reset 2-3 times a day. I frequently lose connect and have to reboot the router. I have tried to contact Virgin, but it is virtually impossible. DO NOT SWITCH TO VIRGIN.",2.0
680,"Virgin media is not fit for purpose.  Broadband speed good when hard wired but wireless is intermittent.  Customer service is non existent. TV service is a joke. The problems are endless and too may to go into here. We had an Engineers visit last year when the system was working, albeit intermittently. but when he left we had no service of anything for 8 days. The next engineer to visit said the first had damaged it. Told we would be compensated in June 2020. Still waiting.  We were updated to 360 in December 2020. Nothing works consistently. Engineer visiting tomorrow but will be the last visit they make other than collecting their equipment when I go back to Sky.  If your'e thinking of going to Virgin Media, DON'T, you will regret it.",1.0
681,"I have been with virgin for a couple of years, goes without saying that I have been having problems with them from day one. After several visits from the engineers, it was ascertained that the problem was in the junction box, instead to add new connections they have patched everyone to the existing one not allowing enough speed to go through to all, hence the connection and the speeds keep dropping. Apparently, they know this as several neighbours have made a complaint but, instead of fixing the problem, they keep sending people out to see the internal connections which we know there are not the problem. The customer service team is horrendous, and when you want to raise a complaint and you ask what exactly is the engineer coming out to fix again, the supervisors hang up on you, very professional",2.0
682,No customer support for technical faults. Facing lot of intermittent connections from 1.5 months. Raised a compliant 2 times no response from these people. I do not suggest to go with these people. Very unresponsive. For virgin ref: compliant numbers are: C-1101213210 and C-150121924.,2.0
683,Virgin Media have not kept their word with anything. Customer service is zero. Terrible. I was promised compensation for no TV or broadband for 6 days. They basically told me Tough! I eventually got Â£7 credit to my account. The fibre broadband keeps dropping out or just no service. Be careful when you sign up. They are very helpful at the start. then it all goes downhill! Now they want to put price up by Â£3.50 Absolutely disgraceful,2.0
684,"Cancellation nightmare - after seeing great offer for VM broadband i decided to switch, then it began! Hub received promptly (best part of the service) but couldnt get it connected so started the tedious time waste of trying to get to talk to anyone over phone or their cs text service for 2 days,who might help.  Next day determined to now cancel this altogether finally got someone after over hours wait and politely asked them to cancel, but guy on phone obviously drilled on trying to keep you, i said over and over again that i had changed my mind and just want to return hub but he waant having any of it, and after confirming my details the call went dead.. i presumed this had been cancelled but then started getting emails and texts welcoming me to VM and and comfirming i am now connected! I replied to every message saying i am not commected and have canceÄºled the switch but this has just continued for a week with my texting and leaving messages to them saying i am not with VM and have cancelled. But, when approaching another provider have been told cannot switch to them as am with VM and they have to  cancel something on their system before i can go elsewhere.  More phone caÄºls not answered. Only 1 of their cs text team seemed to have any idea what was happening but umfortumately told me she was unable to resolve it...but did say my accoumt at that time had not been canceÄºled and was active.  To cut a long story short i have stayed with my current provided who have now offered me a great deal and having explained the issues i hipe have managed to cancel everything, but incase they havnt (as not yet have had any comfirmatiom of cancellatiom from VM) i have made sure no money can be taken by them from my account.",2.0
685,"CROOKS!!AVOID! Broadband speeds and reliability are ok, but if you decide to cancel their service after your contract with them expires is a complete nightmare. First, once you select ""If you are thinking of leaving us"" option on the phone, they put you on a queue, I've waited for up to an hour on occasions and the line randomly hangs up while you are in the queue. If you are lucky enough to get to a customer service representative, they'll try and give you a crap new deal, if you refuse, they'll ""transfer"" you to a colleague and then the big old wait is on and it will randomly hang up again. I've wasted 3 days trying to cancel my service with Virgin and still haven't...Oh, and once they kick you out of the waiting queue, you can't call again for a few hours, they put you in a ban list or something, complete CROOKS!!",2.0
686,"The Virgin internet fibre/cable speeds in Guildford are appalling with 60Mbps max download speed (200 advertised by Virgin) and we get frequent outages. Virgin hiked the cost of their cheapest available phone/TV/internet bundle to Â£74 in a renewed contract in Jan 2021 previously Â£55. My partner gave up a complaining phone call after 70 minutes and used their website complaint system instead but has not had any reply weeks later . Today (21/01/2021) we got a Virgin letter saying the cost is going up by Â£4.00 from March , but we still don't know what we are actually paying yet until the first bill comes in. Is there a true fibreoptic broadband provider in the UK?  Can anyone recommend a better internet provider? What are individual experiences of changing from Virgin to another provider?",2.0
687,"DON'T BE TEMPTED BY THE INITIAL OFFER!I have been with Virgin Media for around 7 years at 3 different properties. When I moved from my 1st to 2nd property I had no issues and the transfer was smooth but it all went down hill from there with them trying to hike prices at least twice a year mid contract. Every time I had to phone to contest taking 2 or 3 phone calls of anything up to an hour. When me and my partner separated I could not move my account with me and had to set up a new one at my new address. Virgin messed up all the passwords so I could not access either account for nearly 3 weeks with multiple phone calls. Had to do a transfer of contract responsibility to my ex so she could take over the bill but they couldn't even get that right after 5 attempts via phone and post. Got that frustrated I just cancelled the account and she had to open a new one in her name. Messed up my passwords and email again and they tried to close both accounts saying that I owed them and early exit fee. Once I got all of this sorted towards the end of my contract an offer came up online on my personal account where I could add the TV and faster broadband to my package for a total of Â£37 a month. Should have known better than to try and upgrade!Received email confirmation of price and package details direct from Virgin Media and my new TiVo box arrived later that week. Set it all up and within a week got my first bill which was over Â£22 more a month than quoted. Here we go again! 42 minute phone call with no result and the promise of a call back from a manager the next day. No call back. Another 47 minute call where I emailed the proof of the price while they were still on the line to the email address they were spelling out for me, only to be told they couldn't access that email and a manager would call me back in 24 hours. Nobody called me back. Another 75 minute phone call speaking to 4 different people and they finally reduced it to.......Â£37.50 and I was told this was the closest they could get the package. These phone calls were the ones when I actually spoke to somebody after multiple times of being on hold for 20 to 30 minutes and then them hanging up.After taking a tv package I realised how little there was to watch on Virgin as you have to pay for the larger bundles if you want any of the sky channels and a large percentage of what is available on Freeview for nothing. This contract ended on the 28th of December so Virgin decided they now want to charge me Â£59 a month for the privilege of rubbish tv, a landline I have never used and averagely performing broadband. A few days later an email also informs me they are putting their prices up a further Â£3.50 as well! I phoned them thinking I will be able to haggle and get a cheap deal as usual but not this time. The cheapest they would do broadband on its own was Â£37 while new customers were getting it at Â£28 so I have cancelled finally. Oh and if you are late paying your bill they will phone you 2 or 3 times a day without fail until its paid but you cant contact them most of the time if you have a problem.If you have got to the bottom of this review I strongly urge you not to give Virgin Media your custom as they are rip off merchants of the highest order and their customer service is non-existent.",2.0

I pay Â£50 a month for this and they have just told me they are increasing the price by Â£3.50. They should be refunding for the speeds I am paying for and never getting. I only stay with them because other suppliers do not have fibre in my area and offer only 10 mbps download speeds. As soon as they do offer fibre, I am leaving. It is disgraceful they are allowed to falsely claim you can expect those download speeds. The truth is you will get no where near them. Absolute con.

692,"absolute joke, after waiting for almost an hour I get through, I complain about the recent email announcing that an increase is on the way (Â£3.50)..my package consisted of  just TV landline and Broadband  and i was paying around the Â£50 per month mark.The woman at the end of the phone up helled the price rise stating that VM was due to put the price up last year but due to the covid 19 they  held back (how saintly) i raised the point that what the difference now from then ie we still have covid and are in full lockdown and in a worse place financially than last year.She replied that its because of the govmt they tell VM to increase the price, (thinking i must sound stupid on the phone )I said that the Gvmt would NEVER tell a company to increase their prices and enlightened her about free enterprise and how the Gvmt actually encourage competition that's why you have the monopolies commission etc, she then said 'its the VAT ..the tax when they put it up'thats what it is (there is a bit of Dunning- Krugar syndrome going on with this woman )I said tax/ VAT are at 20 per cent ,they haven't been changed and if they do it will be announced in April normally , not March ,unless you are psychic. I ask for a cheaper price  , she trys to give me a slight discount but its a sneeky one as it wont last as long as the whole contract , just 6 months , I ask to take away the TV cha that i don't watch and the landline that i don't use , she says her screen has grayed out on that box , she cant help me , but will transfer me to someone else .half hour later i speak to an asian man who takes me through all the sec procedures again , i tell him my problem i he starts to speak fast and on hands free i can only make out the odd word, another transfer, another wait, another taken through security, i say b4 i talk do u have the authority to do what i ask , he says what is it , i tell him give me a price without tv and phone , he quotes me Â£40. i said is that for 100 mps he said yes , i then asked for 60mps  he quoted Â£34 permonth , i said looking at that its dear to other companies, I said i give you 1months notice ..after looking around  and being 60 and all the different routers and cables become confusing so i bottled out. I ring up VM again to reverse the cancellation, i get through after 30 mins to a young asian woman who asked me my name  , address and postcode , i had to spell out my name  then she asks postcode  and house number and turns round and says that my name does not match up with that address, so we go through the landline tel number and i get put on hold for 10 mins, she comes back and says how can i help , i say do you have my details now on screen she says yes  and then we go through security procedure ...again!..i tell her my story and ask her what s the best deal for the old package  i had but with slower Broadband , she says she cant downgrade  any package and puts me through to another agent , 30 mins later i speak to another agent and i say to her is she the right person to do the biz, so i don't waste time , she says she is and i ask her to look at my bundle and if she can do anything as i might reconsider leaving(at this point I'm scheduled for termination 8th feb)she says she can bring it down a little more , and after that being squeezed out of her i then asked for the price if my speed was reduced to 60 mps, she relied (wait for it!!) that due to how the bundles are packaged ,it will be more expensive ????. i said then by your reckoning and logic if i upgrade my package one by adding things on , my monthly payments should reduced, is that correct i asked? she replied i know what your implying and how it sounds ,but it just is ,..I think its a wall to keep the price high. i asked is that the very best she could  do and she said yes , so i said okay we will roll with that....i then hang up the landline phone from her and as i do my mobile rang, i then here the dulcet tones of a mature peoples person old school saleman on the mobile , telling me how sorry  VM that I'm leaving , he tell s me I'm a VIP and the length of time i v been with them how wud i like to have my TV channels ..+ 2 others thrown in , your landline ...and 100 mps broadband for just Â£29 per month.. isaid yes please , i asked about his authority  and he informed me that he is higher up the ladder then Cust Serv by quite a few rungs , so i  say so therefore you have the ability to overule any decision by cust serv and any deal they make you can trump it,,is that correct ? he assures me , i said okay that's fine send me an email with the new revised contract...so the next day i get an email from VM and its the contract for Â£44.30 permonth not Â£29.00.. so because he used a VM  mobile i sent a message to him saying i haven't seen your email yet is everything ok, i didn't get an answer..most likely wont do. but i cant pay Â£44 to them  now after having a deal for Â£29... so i will have to cancel the contract again and do it in writing to head office .. recorded del!!(not falling for that one ) as i have 14 days cool off period. in the letter  i mention my disappointment on not honouring the deal the offered me ..anyway if i don't hear from them  then i have to let things take their  course and find i new provider",2.0

709,"Virgin Review Virgin media - possibly the single worst internet provider I have ever dealt with. Apologies, this is a long review, but I beg you read it. They installed fibre optic into our building, promised tenants superior service enticing a bunch of us to move away from our slower, but stable providers.  After 2 months of problems, 17 customer service calls, and 5 engineers coming to the building, I've had enough.  1) First, when they surveyed the building they failed to check the building wires properly. Whilst it is a new build, every apartment in the building is fitting with air filled cables. Apparently these are not fit for use with Virgin media equipment (I am not an electrician/network specialist - I am repeating what the last Virgin media senior engineer told me). For me this hasn't been a problem, testing the cable shows a good connection but for others in the building it has meant they've switched to Virgin and they are completely unable to connect (air filled cable twisted and shorting out the circuit).  Had they of properly surveyed the building, they would have realised this. 2) Secondly, whilst my connection is fine I was still running into significant downtime. The 4th engineer that came to the property reviewed the fibre centre in the risers of the building to discover that the Virgin Installation team had failed to plug the connections in properly. Meaning that whilst I had a connection, it was only to 1 out of the 4 available network centres. When that centre went down, the building was unable to fail over to any of the other 3 available.  Amazing. Couldn't make this incompetence up. 3) Even now when I am connected to all 4 network centres, Virgin has CONSTANT network issues. I have been without a stable connection for the whole of the Christmas period. I am writing this whilst hot-spotting from my mobile.  4) When I am actually connected to the internet I am on the 200Mbps package with a guaranteed minimum of around 100Mbps - I'd be so lucky. In the 2 months i've been with these jokes, I have at the most 80Mbps but recently its been more like 20-30mbps. Whilst this is plenty for most people, my use case is somewhat unique, especially whilst working from home. My point is, don't bother paying a premium for Virgin thinking you'll get crazy speeds. You won't. .. Don't worry. My complaints don't stop here. 5) I have called approximately 17 times since November 7th to explain the issues. Every time you call, don't expect to be on hold for anything less than 40 minutes before getting to speak with an agent. Certainly don't expect a resolution. After the 10th time I requested to speak with a manager. I've never once been put straight through - its always ""we promise a call back"". NOPE. I have been promised a call back by a manager 5 times and only on ONE occasion has that actually happened. 6) I have asked them for an interim fix for whilst they try fix the network issues (of course, they are unable to tell me what the network issue is). I have suggested a WiFi dongle for when the service is down. NOPE.  7) I've been charged Â£70 for the privilege of dealing with these clowns so far. Their customer service agents don't care about your issue. They don't want to help or find a resolution. They can't tell you what the issues are.  I made the mistake of not looking on here before I went with Virgin. I cannot convey strongly enough how diabolical they are. I am currently collecting evidence to provide to the Ombudsman, speaking with the building management (that manage all the apartments blocks in my area - Paddington) to get Virgin removed from the building and prevent them from falsely advertising their services in all their buildings, and I am speaking with a friend at Hyper Optic hoping he will be able to help get them installed instead.",2.0

Only when you complain do they acknowledge ""known issues"" in your area (May-July and Sept 2020 onwards with the ""fix"" not expected until Feb 2021!!). Throughout these periods the online issues tool stated that there were no issues - useless and outright misleading. In Sept 2020 I naively upgraded from 100Mb (usually getting c90Mbs) to 200Mb, yet only saw speeds of over 100Mb on the single day that the upgrade happened. Thereafter, the speeds were actually worse and the downtimes increased. The online community of experts tries to help but have no real power to do so. And, of course, they try very hard to avoid actually speaking to you.",1.0

713,"A summary of the issues Iâve had with Virgin Media.  I am leaving this review to warn people of the issues I have had, but also in the hope that someone from Virgin will give me some actual explanation for why these issues are happening and when they might be fixed. I still hope to one day get the fast, reliable connection for which I am paying.  - Extremely unreliable connection. During certain periods, my internet will simply temporarily stop working briefly and then reconnect again. This can go on for anything between a day and a week. The issue has been occurring irregularly for over 2 years and Virgin have offered absolutely no reason as to why, despite asking on numerous occasions. I am told there are âintermittent connection issues in your areaâ with no further info. - When searching for faults in my area, the website always shows no faults. However, when phoning (after countless messages urging me to use the website instead), a message does admit thereâs a fault... with no ETA on resolution or explanation of what is happening. - When paying a bill online, sometimes after entering card details etc, the form will tell me that âsomething went wrong, please try again laterâ. On trying again, the same message will appear. On checking my bank statement, I find that I have been charged for BOTH of these supposedly failed transactions, each for over Â£100. - When trying to get a refund for the above, clearly a result of Virginâs defective website, we are told no, âVirgin Media does not give refundsâ using the online chat customer service function. When phoning the next day, a very helpful employee said that yes, I can absolutely have a refund. Why the inconsistency? If I had accepted the first answer, I would be down over Â£100 because of Virginâs incompetence or downright dishonesty. - 10 days later, the bill is still showing as unpaid. - You simply canât log in to the website on certain browsers. On chime, the sign in form just doesnât work. The sign in button does nothing. - The website forces stupidly restrictive password rules, with a maximum length and limit on certain special characters, which actually WEAKEN passwords as well as make my usual variable password convention unusable.- Working from home during the pandemic has often been impossible thanks to connection unreliability. - I live-stream and Virgin is the only high-speed connection in my area, but during common random periods of unreliability, the very expensive internet package I have selected is absolutely useless and a total waste of a very significant bill relative to my income. - It is now Christmas and instead of meeting friends and family I have decided to live-stream with friends in order to adhere to COVID quarantine rules. Of course, now is one of the all too common days of non functional internet. - I donât really ever ask/expect/fish for refunds, but considering the atrocious product and service I am paying for, it is disappointing that Virgin have never once offered any compensation for any of the faults I have experienced.",1.0

744,"I would welcome anyone's views on the grievances outlined in a letter of complaint I sent off by email today. I have now noticed that since sending the letter off, the speed has considerably dropped.  It might be worth mentioning also my yearly contract had finished back in September. I had only been paying 29 sterling as a special promotion for 100mbps when I initially signed up.  By telephone, I attempted to renew the contract and at first I was offered the same packet but for 59 sterling.  I refused to accept it and hung up. But didn't give up and rang again.  But I didn't give up.  By some sort of fluke I managed to get through to Marianne at Customer Retention.  She offered me something completely different for 28 sterling but the same packet for the same speed.  I asked her how so, since I was originally quoted a different price.  She said, in future, just ask to be put through to Customer Retention.  What is this?  There is no option for Customer Retention when you make a call.  Press 1,2,3, 4 for limited options no mention of Customer Retention.  After reading all the reviews of people in similar circumstances, I thought it was worth a mention.  Only after reading other reviews of people being encouraged to accept the initial quote did it ring a bell.  Getting back to my grievances over the last 2 days, here is the letter:- Please note that my reference to being a 'satisfied customer' was in regards to the high speed only.  This was why I signed up in the first place.     TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,  I have been a customer with Virgin media since October 2019 and in that time, I have been more than satisfied with the quality of services provided.  A situation has now arisen in the past two days that requires me to move to another home.  Consequently, I decided to act right away in an attempt to transfer my account to the new address. The address was in the same town, not far from the present address.  By doÄ±ng this, I had no inclination Ä±t would turn out to be a problem lÄ±ke the one that unfolded. Yesterday, I went online to check if your services were available at the new address. I entered the postcode several times on the facility provided via my online account. However, there was an instruction 'please wait' each time I entered. I assumed that maybe this was because there were lots of apartments in the building. Subsequently, I proceeded to enter the online chat facility under 'moving home' to get further clarification on the issue. From the outset of the chat, I specifically outlined the nature of my enquiry ie I would be moving home and I wanted to find out if Virgin Media was available in that area:  and, that my previous attempts to enter the postcode had been unsuccessful. This was not clarified immediately by the agent but instead, he proceeded to ask for security details and lots of information relating to the new address. He also asked if I wanted Virgin Media at the new address to which I replied 'I did'.  Since this turned out to be a lengthy procedure, I interpreted it as meaning that the service was indeed available at the new address;  after all I had not been advised otherwise. Or, indeed my interpretation was that I needed to go through this procedure just to find out if services were, in fact available in the area. The correspondence ended with the agent advising me that another agent would be in touch in the next 45 minutes. In the meantime, I decided to call Virgin Media for further clarification.  I explained what had happened as outlined above.  The agent advised that it was an unnecessary procedure and there should have been a check beforehand to establish if the service was available at said location. He then kindly proceeded to check this out and was able to confirm that it wasn't in fact, available. He also advised there would be a fee for disconnection. I was disappointed when I heard this and the agent was sympathetic to my concerns.  He was very helpful and kindly offered to transfer me to customer care which I accepted. I waited for 20 minutes but there was no reply. Despite this, I continued to the chat facility in the hope that maybe there would be some other options available.  Before I could get to explain what had happened, the agent took me through the whole process again asking for lots of information. In between times, I asked if he could see the messages from the first point of contact where I had already given all the same information.  As time went on, I became increasingly frustrated and the conversation was just one of disarray and confusion. At the end of it, he said the service was indeed not available and that there would be a fee for disconnection.  Then he encouraged me to book a cancellation date. My account of the correspondence, leads me to my poÄ±nt in writing to you.  My grievance is twofold: 1    I can only describe yesterday's communication as a mission impossible.  For at least four hours, I was trying to clarify something that could have been clarified at the outset.  In addition, there was no consistency in the means of communication, at least not what one would expect from a high profile service provider.  It provided nothing but unnecessary confusion for such a simple inquiry.  Of course with exception to the agent's help via telephone call. My hope is that in highlighting the matter, you may take it on board and review it for whatever purposes. 2   The above, coupled with the fact that I was alarmed to learn that I would have to pay a disconnection fee.  This, I find totally incomprehensible.  Taking into consideration the fact that I did not wish to leave Virgin Media  in the first place and that your broadband service was not available for that location. It was not a matter of me being dissatisfied with your services.  Why, therefore should I be penalised for something that is totally out of my control? When I renewed my contract back in September, I could not foresee that I would be moving home in the future. It came about out of necessity. Just like I could not foresee the service would not be available at the new address.  The terms of the contract do not allow for such a predicament.  In other words, when I agreed to that contract, I did so, because I was happy with the service after one year's subscription. I never perceived that I would leave it, no matter what the circumstances. I could understand it would be different if It had been a situation whereby I had chosen to leave the service as a dissatisfied customer.  Indeed, I would accept, via the terms of the contract, I was liable to pay a disconnection fee.  This however is not the case. Furthermore, I am a single parent who is really struggling to make ends meet under the benefits system at this period of time.  The internet connection is a valuable lifeline for me and my child. In that respect, no matter how a little money I receive every month, I have always made it a priority when it comes to paying the essential bills. Thereby a loyal customer.  I would also add that even if I was of affluent status, the principle of the matter outlined above would still remain the same. Now, I find myself in a situation whereby I must move to another home which incurs further costs.  Perhaps you can understand, that such a fee on top of that, I would struggle to pay; and simply have not got the funds to do so. In light of these circumstances and for the reasons aforementioned, I would appeal to you to consider a waiver of the penalty fee. Trusting you will acknowledge. I am enclosing a record of yesterday's correspondence for reference.  So the above letter outlined my grievances.  I again decided to contact them out of sheer frustration, not wanting to let it go  This time, (after waiting 30 minutes for a response and paying for the call) I asked what the options where. This individual advised that when I pay the diconnection fee and hook up with another provider, that provider will cover the cost of the fee as part of their payment plan.  Now, I ask all of you out there.  Have you ever heard anything the likes of?????  He's on the other side of a phone call and he thinks I was born yesterday!!!! Honestly as we say too good to be true.  Wish it were that simple! I then asked if there was any way of airing the complaint since the address I sent the mail off to was the only address I could find (after much deliberation on Google Search).  There was no facility on their online system for making a complaint.  He further advised me to make the issues known on twitter and facebook.  Really, can I trust this? Really folks, should customer care not be of utmost priority?  They are Virgin Media and invincible because of their good reviews for high speeds.  Was that not a ploy to get the customers in the initial stages.  Why have so many perople mentioned that speeds have been reduced.  How can the customer have faith?

Speaking with the team at virgin they say to ""empty your downloads"" - We had no downloads - and then they would check there is no faults, according the virgin there never was a fault so they wouldn't help. When our wifi occasionally started to drop out we where told very similar things ""there's no fault"" ""It must be your device"" etc, well funny that 8 different devices can throw up the exact same issue. Upon our contract coming to the end of the first year we got offered a renewal price of over Â£60 for a service we paid under Â£30 for! I called and asked for their best price and they said Â£58 was the absolute best. I got the exact same package at talktalk for Â£25 so called back to cancel and all of a sudden they offered us the exact same package for Â£28. If that was offered at first then MAYBE I would have considered it but having spent hours waiting on hold to be told an entire bunch of different rubbish by virgin media I decided enough was enough. After cancelling Virgin I was still stuck with them for 30 days, during this period my wifi speed dropped from 100mbps down to between 10 and 20 mbps. I'm glad I'm no longer with this money hungry service.- Over 1 hour wait times outside of covid-19- Almost 2 hour wait time inside of covid-19- Webchat for support is incredibly glitchy, you get refreshed out, the wait time displays as 1 second even though you'll wait over an hour.- Service is slowed after cancelling- Random additional charges of Â£1 - Â£5 added to your bills with no explanation.- Try at every cost to con you into paying above the odds- Online portal doesn't work for half the pages, you cannot look at prices, update details etc. Honestly terrible company.",1.0

I received an email from Virgin Media asking me to call a number ""as some of the information required was missing"".  I called the number ; BIG MISTAKE !What followed was 30 minutes of high pressure sales during which ;1. The phone connection went down three times, and I was called back.2. I could barely understand what the caller was saying.3. The caller asked for the first, third and fifth character in my password ..... I thought only I was supposed to know my password.... obvious security implications for my account.4. I was coerced into 350 Mb/s internet, which I can't afford, and which has a contract length of 18months versus 1 month for 200Mb/s.5. I was coerced into opening a Virgin Mobile account, which I don't want, and which included the caller asking me for an account password, security implications AGAIN.6. When I was asked for bank details, which Virgin Media already have, as I pay by direct debit, I ""smelled a rat"". I told the caller I wanted my account reverting back to the way it was after which the caller still insisted I carry on with the process. I told the caller I was going to hang up the phone now, and my account should be reverted back to normal, and I hung up.7. Less than 1 minute later, the caller rang again and before they could say anything, I told them that our dealings were finished and I wanted my account reverting back to the way it was, and hung up. The initial email I was sent asking me to call them was misleading, and dishonest ; it used the excuse of needing information to subject me to a sales call ; had they said, honestly, that it was a sales call, I wouldn't have bothered. So here I ; still haven't got 200Mb/s internet, wasted 30 minutes of my life trying to understand a phone caller, and Virgin Media don't want to communicate with me about my email to them......

VM started adding late payment fees, threats of credit reference affected, court summons etcWe wrote to complain formally, VM replied assuring case escalated, someone will call to discuss, no phone callWe filed complain with CISAS, VM replied, claimed they called, but no answer, not true as no missed calls, VM request we text them, we did, several times, no repliesThen VM terminated our service, leaving us without phone or broadband in middle of CV19 pandemic unable for both of us to work from home!CISAS accepted our complain, gave VM 10 days to reply, VM did not even bothered to reply to CISAS until 11th day, a day after dateline, VM submitted their printouts of their system notes of my account where all important facts like my original email stating I'm applying for account transfer on same package and price per month, we're missing, instead VM's notes states; no record! VM subjected us to 3 months of hell, hoping their could bully us into paying their unwarranted demand, not realising we would stand firm against such malicious thieving corporates.We persevered, at extreme stress and cost having to tether our phone connection at higher mobile internet cost which are at best unreliable, prone to drop outs etc, but we would not allow VM to think they can bulky us.Never again, after this contract expires, will we EVER transact any VM services again ... Avoid or be at your own peril",2.0

807,"Absolutely awful.I've been having broadband and phone issues for quite some time, admittedly its intermittent. It might be fine for a month, then down for a week, then working again for a week, then down for a day. Phoned VirginMedia customer support numerous times, I've had a new router, been told its a area outage although nothing appears on the website. Eventually they sent an engineer who took about 10 minutes to discover there is a problem with the line running from the cabinet in the street to the house and it needs to be replaced, an engineer was booked and I didn't mind having to wait the 3 weeks.Day of the appointment arrives, no-one turns up. Service starts working again and I assume everything is fine.Then I get a text message confirming an engineer booking, I call Virgin to check whats going on and apparently someone did come but didn't want to bother me, the person they told to make sure I was in and asked to confirm if I had any COVID-19 sysmptoms, as they were only working outside. Anyway turns out they couldn't replace the cable so another team were sent, I don't know if this lot turned up but no-one let me know if they were here. They also couldn't replace the cable so a third team were sent, this one definitely did arrive because they knocked on the door and spoke to us. They replaced the cable and I was then getting full speed internet again... only they broke the phone service.Once again I had to call VirginMedia who didn't answer the phone, so I booked an engineer online, they came out and couldn't fix the issue, instead they had to send another engineer to port my phone over so, after about 10 days with no phone,  it is now connected to my SuperHub3 (which is not super at all, it may be the worst router I have ever used... and I've been a customer since the NTL days so I've had plenty of useless VirginMedia kit).In between all of this I have phoned and made complaints, they don't really care. First I asked for the automatic compensation, but apparently because the service was intermittent, you see sometimes my 362Mb service managed to achieve a 0.1Mb upload speed, so it wasn't completely broken. OK well what about the phone line that they broke, apparently the computer says NO, its an automatic thing and Ofcom a actually makes the decision, not VirginMedia and Ofcom says that them breaking it doesn't qualify as actually being broken. Absolute Rubbish!I'm not concerned with compensation, all I want is not to have to pay for a service that wasn't getting, I don't think that's unreasonable, but they won't offer me more that Â£20 after the 3 months of terrible service, lots of engineer visits and taking Â£150 in bills.

So with just 4 days left, I had to scramble to get Sky to keep my broadband up and til the 18th Septmeber, the new installation date.

We have discussed this extensively on Facebook.   When I managed to speak by telephone to someone at VM, I was told that they had identified a fault locally on 7 July which would involve intermittent (meaning there would be no financial compensation!) losses of signal until 24 July.  This sounds like quite a fault if it would take 17 days to address.  Apparently, others locally have spoken to VM by telephone and have received various possible explanations of the losses, indicating that the customer service people don't have a clue of what exactly is going on! A loss of service occurred again on 3 August, then again on 16, 17, 18 August.  It seems that there is now likely to be a regular series of such 'intermittent' faults.The same thing has happened twice already today. I have now written to VM Complaints in Sunderland three times, the first on 24 July.  None of my letters have been replied to! Not only is this a disturbingly regular loss of internet service from VM, especially when I rely on the service for external security camera recordings, telephone and Fire Stick TV reception, as well as general computer access to the internet, but their customer service is absolutely appalling. As VM are failing to respond to my written requests for information, I may be obliged to contact OFCOM for further advice. VM seem concerned more about boasting of their high speeds (100 Mbs here, but 50 Mbs would suit me), yet failing to supply a reliable service. Finally, I look forward to the possibility that a different company may eventually offer a competing fibre service in this area, as I would certainly move to that company.

Called, waited 43mins, told it's new monthly total, previous monthly total Â£26 cannot be transferred, we explained that we were told same package at same price can be transferred by VM, but VM customer service will not budge. On opening the first invoice, I found my correct 9 digit account number and area reference, so I tried to register an online account, but this time, VM's website says, an account has already been set up for my NEW account, and it was in the name of our previous flatmate, even though he was on a totally different account number! So I still cannot open on online account! Luckily when I emailed my application to apply for transfer, I was concerned that we only had a verbal assurance from VM regarding retaining the Â£26 monthly bundle cost, so I had mentioned in my email that I'm applying for this transfer based on the assurance that its the same package at the same price. We called again to try and lodge a formal complaint, waited 30mins, call automatically dropped. Called back, waited another 45mins, answered, and as soon as I stated we wanted to make a formal complaint, the call was dropped! As advised by local council consumer services officer, we've sent in a formal written complaint, as we've given up ringing their customer service, and cannot use their website form as it requires an online account which VM's system is unable to allow me to register. Entire experience have been stressful, but more bewildered as to how a supposedly professional company like Virgin Media could have such an unprofessional infantile customer service, and after persistently refusing to reply and broken promises, VM alleges we're late in paying our bills, so now imposing late charges etc and has terminated our service, thus rendering us in serious position of not able to work from home! In desperation, we called VM, waited over 50 minutes in queue, spoke to ""customer service"" who sounded very emphatic, says will take ownership of our complaint, truly understand our case is urgent, will escalate and Manager will get back to us within two hours""That's two days ago, still no reply whatsoever!Have filed complaint with CISAS, the official ofcom regulator, but as this process is going to take weeks, guess VM is using this tactic scam knowing most desperate users, especially those working from home in this CV19 period, would cave in and pay up!How our current system allows such inconsiderate corporates to take advantage of our national plight is beyond me, we will definately not be using this company again and would strongly NOT recommend Virgin Media, shame it's another British sham ...",2.0
848,"I've had an incredibly bad start with Virgin. I called weeks in advance to set up the wifi in my new place to avoid being here working from home without wifi. I received a weirdly garbled text from Virgin late on a Saturday night that my Monday installation was being moved back nearly three additional weeks later. I got repeat messages -- one a day after the original installation date and then the same message two days after -- telling me that the external work had been completed. However, when I called to try to move my installation date earlier, they could only move it 1.5 days earlier. The customer service agent sounded like a robot just repeating, ""I'm sorry but we have no availabilities sooner"" even when that wasn't a response to what I was actually saying (I heard them the first time). It feels very clear to me that they don't care that it takes them SIX weeks to set up wifi, which is an utterly absurd amount of time. If there are not enough availabilities for engineers to set up wifi for customers within six weeks, they clearly need to hire more engineers because right now they are providing apalling customer service.",2.0

Gave them plenty of notice, even said that if I could sign up with them again once Iâd moved (moving in with a friend whoâs on a contract with BT), I would. Not now. NEVER AGAIN! Just on todayâs calls alone, I held for around 45 mins before getting to the moving home team. Spoke to the guy who answered for 15 mins, he told me that the billing team would deal with my complaint, so I asked to be put through to them. Held for another 30 mins only for them to hang up on me. Called back again, finally got through to billing after another 35 mins, and and then got the same answer.   They sent the packaging for returning the kit to my new address 3 weeks early, now Iâm being emailed and txtâd saying Iâll incur a penalty charge if I donât return it. Iâm still paying them for the service! Direct debit of Â£54 comes out on 13 August, I move out on 10 August and was originally told the final bill would be just over Â£3. So do they generate a final invoice for this amount? They certainly donât. They say they will still take the direct debit of Â£54 and then send a cheque for the credit (yes, you read it right - a cheque!!!). Immediately? No, why stop there. Theyâll send it via post after 45 days. What the heck!!! Who uses cheques? And why 45 days you may well ask. Apparently it takes that long to process. Seriously?!  And as if that wasnât enough to send me over the edge, then the final straw was when I checked whether they had my new address on file to actually send the cheque to. I thought it wouldnât be safe to assume that as the boxes for the kit had been sent to my new address it would follow that one department might actually communicate with another. Just as well I checked - billing didnât have this on my account. They do now.  I feel sorry for the man and the woman who I spoke to this morning as theyâre just on the other end of the line.

915,"Thanks to Virigin Media, I got a new Broadband contract that cut off my Internet during Homeoffice, costs me Â£20 more than my previous Virgin contract with the same bandwidth and bills me Â£113 for account change. Neither the customer service hotline nor support wanted to help me, so maybe this gets more visibility. My flatmate moved out in the beginning of the year and I was supposed to take over his Virigin contract which was supposed to end in May 2020. I filled out a form to transfer accounts and have not heard anything for another 2 months.A bill for Â£80.86 arrived. Where our previous bills were Â£29 each. Charges for an account change and a monthly package price of Â£49. I tried to create a Virgin Media Online account to get insights on my contract and billing, unfortunately the online account was still registered to my old flatmates email address. I couldnât request a change of online account owner, nor could I login without the email. So my 2 problems are: - I got billed more than I was previously paying- I did not have any access to my Virgin Account and was not able to create a new one with the account number stated on the invoice  So I gave up and called customer support. The lady asked for the pin â which I never received for this account. Luckily, I could provide her with my personal data, so she could access the account. She explained that the Â£29 were for the first year only and after some discussion she offered me a package with a lower bandwidth for Â£36 instead of Â£49. I agreed.I also explained to her that I donât have access to my online account, she said that she would email me including the confirmation of the account changes and the link to get access to my online account. None of the above happened. Problem 1 and 2 still unsolved. 2 months later, we received another invoice for Â£80.86, a letter confirming the account changes and stating a discount for the month of May and another invoice for Â£113.98. And the worst of all, our Internet got cut off. Itâs lockdown, we are doing homeoffice and we canât get our work done without Wifi. I am more than happy to pay my bills, but I am not accepting to be treated like this as a customer. I called customer service again. This time it took a while until I was even able to speak to someone because the automated voicemail asked me to pay the outstanding bill first. Eventually, I got to speak to someone. I was asked to provide my account number (got it on the bill), my name (obvious), account pin (I never had it), address (got it) and finally my birthday (got it). Then I was told the information was wrong and she could not discuss the account further with me. She asked for the sort code which is linked to the account as a last resort. Since I never provided any nor had access to my account I could not provide it. She said that there is nothing she can do for me due to security reasons. Why did it work the first time then? I asked her to escalate it internally, so she created a complaint and told me that her manager will be in touch. That has not happened yet. I did pay the bill now to be able to work from home, but this is a horrible customer experience. I am going to terminate this contract asap and avoid Virgin Media in the future. 0 Problems solvedI had to pay Â£113 paid instead of normal Â£29I'm stuck with this contract until May 2021& I still have no access to my Virgin Media Account Never again.",2.0

When we received VM email confirming transfer complete with new account number, we logged on website to set up online account and ddm, but VM website says A/c number wrong, and requested Area reference which isn't stated anywhere! We called, wait in queue for 25mins, answered, told new account number not coincide with my name, cannot proceed, refused to help further! Then received email from VM with my first invoice for Â£52 per month, not Â£29! Called, waited 43mins, told it's new monthly total, previous monthly total Â£26 cannot be transferred, we explained that we were told same package at same price can be transferred by VM, but VM customer service will not budge. On opening the first invoice, I found my correct 9 digit account number and area reference, so I tried to register an online account, but this time, VM's website says, an account has already been set up for my NEW account, and it was in the name of our previous flatmate, even though he was on a totally different account number! So I still cannot open on online account! Luckily when I emailed my application to apply for transfer, I was concerned that we only had a verbal assurance from VM regarding retaining the Â£26 monthly bundle cost, so I had mentioned in my email that I'm applying for this transfer based on the assurance that its the same package at the same price. We called again to try and lodge a formal complaint, waited 30mins, call automatically dropped. Called back, waited another 45mins, answered, and as soon as I stated we wanted to make a formal complaint, the call was dropped! As advised by local council consumer services officer, we've sent in a formal written complaint, as we've given up ringing their customer service, and cannot use their website form as it requires an online account which VM's system is unable to allow me to register. Entire experience have been stressful, but more bewildered as to how a supposedly professional company like Virgin Media could have such an unprofessional infantile customer service, we will definately not be using this company again and would strongly NOT recommend Virgin Media, shame it's another British sham",2.0

934,"Virgin Media wired up the next-door neighbour's technology incorrectly and has caused many problems to this address, also having carried out work - no doubt also way below safety-standard protocols  - to another neighbour's house in the area, too.  When the company is called about the problem, they lie, saying that they have checked the property's wiring, when they haven't, despite these effects having caused all sorts of issues such as extreme static-charge in and around the house to life-threatening levels, radioactive effects hitting the immune-system and high-pitch frequency effects causing ear-aches for days, the company having had all of these details relayed to them. Virgin Media does not care about the lives of people, they care only about profit via aggressive sales tactics and bad wiring. Stay away. They are bad people. Five years these effects have hurt people and Virgin Media simply does not want to take responsibility for their under-trained representative's mistakes because they do not wish to be seen as liable. The ISP we were with at the time even stated that Virgin Media has messed up their own installations of technology in the past. These people are some of the lowest of the low. Surrounded by advertising and plenty of profit which people keep feeding them without thinking about the consequences. Am sure that if there was really proper, alternative regulation to the mirage of an organisation that is Ofcom, a proper international regulatory counter-corruption organisation that was able to deal with these types of criminal companies, then Virgin Media, as well as companies like Vodafone, would not be trading (maybe down the odd back-alley).",2.0

Join Virgin Media:-If you have literally nothing to do and enjoy endless hours waiting to speak to customer services and then getting repeatedly cut off after your 55 minute waits (rack up 60+ hours of calls over 9 months trying to resolve a few things Virgin should never have done e.g. charging you for a TV package you cancelled 8 months prior -when you promptly returned the TV box to them 8 months earlier and acknowledged receipt of it. This has been going on since mid 2019 and now June 2020 so way before the pandemic before that is used as an excuse! -If you enjoy being sent from department to department since no-one can resolve simple issues, hours and hours wasted, calls are routinely disconnected after long waits and if they repeatedly promise you that a manager will call you back -know that they wonât! -If you enjoy being overcharged for all sorts of thing.-If you enjoy being put on a overpriced broadband contract (almost double the offers they have online) which you never agreed to after your last contract ended and you repeatedly told them you didnât want to be on a new contract (which they agreed to) but would only be on a rolling one until they resolved the issues (which it took them 8 months to do)! They agreed one price for the rolling contract but charged Â£12 extra /month and refused to refund it or listen to their recorded calls. As an extra bonus they will charge you another Â£40 set up fee for the 2nd/new overpriced contract that you never agreed to and will refuse to refund this illegal set up fee.-If you enjoy a dodgy service (when I had the TV box it only worked 40-50% of the time so I ended up just not watching it as Iâd have to call Virgin each time and it was too painful. The internet is fine (where I am in central London, canât speak for elsewhere) but several issues even with that. Iâm assuming that most would disagree re the internet being fine as the WhatsApp group for my area -300+ people- are always complaining about Virginâs internet.-Etc. I could literally carry on with numerous other examples but have wasted too much time already. Literally feel like I've been tortured by Virgin Media as they messed up so many things and one issue took 8 months and about 60 hours of me calling and still not resolved -promised calls back by managers I never got, could never get through, etc. So painful. Iâve just paid them their illegal charges to be rid of them and to cancel the contract but will write a more detailed report for the Communication and Internet Adjudication Scheme (CISAS) -Virgin is not signed up with the main Ombusman services so CISAS is who you contact if you if have an issue with Virgin.

However, days later, the order had not gone through. I had to ring multiple times and basically got told they would not honour the previous agreement. So patronising (I used to work for another provider, and hold a Masters degree in Telecommincation Engineering, but they treat me like I'm an idiot). Pack of lies.  We're now stuck with them as my back was against the wall.  I wish I'd switched. Shouldn't have touched them with a bargepole! This is the latest of the issues I've had with them.  Soon after we had their BB my email stopped working.  They blamed all my clients (on iOS, Windows, Ubuntu and Android) when it was their servers.

So many issues and a lack of quality. If it's working the speed is generally good (especially as we can't currently get VDSL here) though the TV service leaves much to be desired with missed recordings and the like.  We've enjoyed advertised speeds with no sign of contention, good latency and reasonably reliable WiFi from the Arris hub. However, when things go wrong, and they will, the Customer Service is dire and is bad on so many levels.

I am currently getting 0.5Mb/a right beside the router.  You contact customer service and they waffle on, spoon feeding you a load of rubbish. The worst provider going by a significant margin.

991,"Virgin is fast. Unfortunately, it isn't very reliable, and their Customer Service and Tech Support is incredibly poor. This is what happens when you outsource the majority of your tech support to Indian Call Centres. Virgin seem to use ""speed, speed, speed!"" as an exclusive measurement of connection performance. If you're having any issues, then they'll immediately blame your Wi-Fi connection, even if you're not using Wi-Fi (like me). They don't seem to care about the quality or reliability of your connection which can cause more problems than simply the speed of your connection. It is suspected that many of their reliability problems are caused by over-subscribing their network - trying to accommodate more customers than their infrastructure can physically handle. I find it hard to recommend Virgin for consumers right now - if you can get a decent connection from BT/Openreach, then perhaps you should go with them instead.",2.0

I'm therefore being discriminated against new customers.  I've currently been offered a package at Â£38 (best deal they can offer) which is online to new customers at Â£29.99. This is unethical and I do not understand how they get away with this shameful business practice.* They said to me I could not move to another provider as currently Corona Virus restrictions mean their competitors cannot complete any installs.  They are using this as a tool to keep prices high knowing I can't go to their competitors with current movement restrictions. Further:* Their Customer Services have been extremely poor for a number of years. One example is they cannot send my bills to my personal email address - because I used it at a previous address when I moved house. I could go on, but will spare all the details.* Virgin Media also said that if I cancel, then no one else can take out a contract with Virgin at my address for at lease 3 months.",2.0

We can't cancel our contract without incurring an Â£80 penalty fee, because Virgin record the intermittent outages (i.e out for 10 minutes at a time, every half hour) as separate incidents, and thus the outage doesn't last long enough to trigger the cancellation clause. We're literally being held hostage. Avoid at all costs.",1.0
999,"I am giving Virgin Media 1 star because there is no 0 star option. They have absolutely the worst customer-service of all the ISP's (we own 12 properties and use several ISP's), as well as being the worst for broadband speed and reliability. We have always had problems with VM - both with broadband speed and reliability, and with customer -service. Today was typical of our experience with VM. This morning I had to contact them about issues pertaining to two properties. PROPERTY 1: We have had broadband problems (e.g. upload speed of 0.01Mbps - this is not a typo - just one HUNDREDTH of one Mbps) for more than 1 MONTH, and received a text message (for the third time!) advising the problem is fixed, even though it is not. Spent 52 MINUTES ON HOLD (this is not that unusual for VM even before the coronavirus) when I called. When I finally got through, VM said they know about the problem and their engineer will sort it out asap. I said VM has been saying this for weeks and asked why VM keeps sending such messages if they know the problem is not fixed - VM did not have an answer for that. I advised that on 4 March I wanted to speak to a manager, was told that none were available to speak to me, but was promised that a note would be placed on the account for a manager to call me back within 48 hours. I advised that it has now been 20 DAYS and no call, only to be told that the last person I spoke to at VM did not place a note on the account for a manager to call! I asked the lady I was speaking to today to place a note on the account for a manager to call and confirm to me that she has definitely done so. However, I do not hold out any hope that a manager from VM will bother to call me. PROPERTY 2: Potential serious issue with a new account, tried to call VM, kept on hold for 87 MINUTES, then recorded message saying they cannot process my call and to call back later. Found VM email address on an old email from VM, and sent an email explaining the problem. Received an automated reply saying VM do not monitor this email address and to contact them through the website. Website options do not match the issue and I keep getting directed to FAQ's with no option to send message to VM - spent the last HOUR trying to find some way to email or message them with no luck. Unfortunately, in the two properties above VM is the only ISP that can provide fibre-broadband at the moment, so we have no option but to use them. However, we have decided that for the other properties we will no longer use VM and will cancel the other VM accounts as soon we are out of the contract period. For anyone who is thinking of opening an account with Virgin Media I say if what you really want is very poor broadband-service and worse customer-service, and you really, really enjoy spending literally hours on hold to sort out issues, then VM is definitely for you. The rest of us who want reasonably dependable broadband and good customer-service will go elsewhere.",1.0

They don't seem to understand how their own systems work and when you ask for their managers email to complain they give you a generic office email so they can hide all their many issues and lack of ability. They don't seem to understand their own systems. Really poor.,1.0

1079,"I had only bad experiences with Virgin Media, from start to finish:1. Sales: I called Virgin Media to get broadband. The guy was on a Monday morning mood, could barely understand what he was saying, he made no effort to speak clearly, instead he started shouting in the phone thinking that might help. He gave me broadband and mobile in a bundle which was good as I wantedmobile as well, but thinking of getting it from EE. We arrange for service installation on day x between 13.00 - 18.00.2. I see one day that there is a cable lump coming out of the ground on my patio in front of the house. The patio looked messy, I could see that too. No one told me anything about this, so I thought it might be the council doing whatever works in the area. Really poor communication from Virgin.3. Day x comes and the technician gives me a call at 12.00 saying he will be at my property in 10 min. I say I'm away as I made plans for the morning and will be there just before 13.00 when the allocated slot for installation should begin. The guy shouts at me in the phone and says if I'm not there at 12.30 he will leave the property and mark this as a missed appoitment. Then hangs up on me. I had to rush through traffic as I was away on a course in Birmingham.Finally got home at 12.45 and saw the guy already drilled 3 holes in the house and mounted an outside box. All these without my approval and in my absence.I immediately stop him from progressing the work as it is a rented house and didn't have landlords approval. He immediately starts moaning that I am wasting his time and that I should've get the landlords agreement before hand. I say you're wasting my time as it is before 13.00 and in theory this is my time. I say I didn't know we had to drill holes etc as no one told me what the installation involves. I thought it will use the existing infrastructure in the house,i.e. just swap the existing router from Vodafone with the Virgin Media one and set that up. The guy keeps sucking his teeth and moaning about the waste of time. At 13.00 he leaves saying he won't waste anymore of his time on me. How rude! He made such a big deal of his time, that he actually screwed everything up and leftat 13.00 when the allocated slot was starting. I wanted to mention it to him, the fact that before 13.00 is actually my time, but I was afraid the guy will snap and start being violent. So I left it there.4. Later on a lady from the pre-install team calls asking what happenned. I tell her the story and then say I would like to cancel my services as I didn't appreciate the technicians behaviour. She insists I should carry on with the installation and asked for an installation date. In the mean time I went to the agency down town to talk to the letting agent about this as they weren't answering the phone. They said it's ok to install and the landlord is happy with that.I informed the lady about this, but said I wouldn't be able to be available for the installation soon, so I'll go to a different supplier anyway who will post the router through the letter box for me to install it myself. She kept insisting I should go forward with installation. She put so much pressure on me and also started making me feel bad for not finishing the installation saying they went to such great lenghts to get another installation date for me. I realised the abuse and signed out saying I definitely don't want to go for Virgin Media services anymore. Now they ring me every day to ask me to install the services and every day I say no. I'll have to bar the caller at some point as this can't continue like this. Really abusive people. I would like to get in touch with a regulatory authority to mention this as I don't think this is good behaviour. I actually think it's abusive!!!

Originally had huge issues over receiving the box because it hadn't been delivered and each time i rang to ask, I got told it had already been delivered which was very clear it hadn't. Spent two whole evenings on the phone to them, until I lost my patience and they then decided to send someone out to me to install it free of charge. At the time i told them i wouldn't be paying for the time it took them to install it which they agreed. They offered compensation of Â£5 for everyday late it was but sent me through a cheque for a quarter of this. To top that off i noticed a charge added to my bill for the amount of the cheque they sent me, so they had charged me for my compensation! A month later my complaint got resolved because they couldn't get hold of me, despite having my email, phone number and home address. Obviously they try so hard (NOT). I set up a direct debit for payments and it was showing on my bank account but they didn't collect the money and have tried to charge me for a late payment fee. Needless to say, i am fuming, another 2 hours on the phone to them. Be very aware they try to slip in additional charges on to your bill and thy purposefully make the bills unclear. Compensation still hasn't been added on despite them saying it had been added.

1143,"Copy of my complaint email to Virgin CEO Lutz Schueler: Dear Mr Shueler, I am writing this email whilst on hold with your customer service team, 41 minutes in at this point, being passed from customer service to cancellations and back.... I have been a customer of Virgin for over 15 years and have had enough over the last month with my broadband not working properly. After giving Virgin over 9 attempts to resolve the issue I have now decided to cancel the contract as I cannot afford to be taking time off for your engineers to visit and being late for work whilst trying to resolve the issues. Not to mention the many hours spent on the phone with your customer service, wasting my evenings and weekends. 1 hour 3 minutes on the phone with customer service & counting..... I have now been told that I will have to pay a penalty as I am contracted to Virgin until February 2020... this after paying you for a service that you were unable to provide. I am sure that under my consumer rights I should not be penalised for cancellation of a service that you did not provide adequately. Oh, I have just been advised that customer service closes @ 9pm and that someone will call me tomorrow. Over an hour on the phone...wow! This attempt to play hardball with customers and pressure/ force them to keep parting with their money for an inferior, sometimes non existent service will only lead to Virgin Media gradually losing total confidence from their customers and as you well know bad reviews travel much wider than good ones. One of the issues that pushed me over the edge, was Virgin's total disregard for their customers time, offering a discount of Â£32, for not providing adequate service for a month impacting on homework, coursework, working from home and general tasks which are all very dependent on having an internet connection. In addition the 2 days off work for engineers visits, being late for work and a wild guess of 10's of hours wasted on the phone with customer service - at least it felt that long. Plus penalty clauses for termination of a service not received as paid for. I would like to think that a reputable company the size of Virgin respects and treats their loyal customers fairly, which is why I have gone to the principal directly with this predicament. Normally large organisations take their lead from the top and are the mirror image of their leaders. I would like you to intervene, contact your cancellation team, to advise them that they are entitled to only 3 attempts to resolve the issues - let alone 9 attempts, before they are obliged to accept my termination of the contract without any further penalty charges applying. On another note, I have been contemplating moving all 4 of our mobile telephone contracts to Virgin Mobile, actually moved the 1st one just last weekend - which I am now thinking was a mistake and maybe I should utilise the 14 day return/ cancellation period. All of Virgin Media should be very careful how they treat their customers as there may be knock on consequences if consumers feel that they are taken for granted. Customers are easily lost but very difficult to then regain their trust. I will await your response for the next 7 days, until Thursday 24th October 2019, after which I will be forced to make a formal complaint to OFCOM and request their recommendations on my consumer rights relating to this complaint. I most sincerely hope that you will respond to this complaint and use it to try to improve Virgin Media's service provided to it's customers, as well as change my current impression of the company, too big to care about their customers views.  Best regards *THE RESPONSE*: We would like to thank you for taking the time to contact us today. We are very sorry to hear that you are unhappy and we will endeavour to resolve your issues as soon as possible. Lutz is currently not available to deal with your complaint personally, however we have passed your email onto a member of his team, and they will be in touch with you as soon as possible in order to assist you with your queries. We look forward to discussing this matter with you in the future. Kind regards, Roopa Murugan On behalf of Lutz Schuler.  Nearly 4 weeks have passed, nothing more from the CEO's office, I do wonder where this disdain for customers comes from, from the top maybe?  I THEN HAD THIS EMAILED TO ME: Get the Bigger bundle with M200 Fibre Broadband for Â£49 a month, if you stay..

If you have any questions about your bill, please visit My Virgin Media. Kind regards, The Virgin Media team   SO TO RECAP: They offered Â£49 per month + M200 broadband in their email and when I clicked on the link to accept that I then got a confirmation of Â£56 per month + M100 Broadband, this to try to convince me to stay, hahahah. When I contacted them to ask why the difference in offer to confirmation they told me they couldn't change anything and that I would have to send them proof of the offer. I have to prove what THEY sent me in a an email, I still can't believe it whilst writing this. I then advised them that I want to cancel that change in contract and revert back to my cancellation date of 16/11 as they did not supply the contract that they originally offered. They had the cheek to say that I have to give them 30 days notice and pay penalties. I have advised them that I will only pay for my services until the 16/11, the cancelation date agreed without penalties before they tricked me into extending the contract. I will cancel my direct debit and they can take me to court to explain to a Judge how they tried to con me. *** BEWARE OF VIRGIN MEDIA _ CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A SHAMBLES_YOU GET PASSED FROM INDIA TO SCOTLAND TO INDIA TO SCOTLAND...â¦...DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU***",1.0

They also tried to sound like they had done me a favour! Second time... I said I was canceling my account and going with a different provider. They had offered that if I take a virgin mobile sim I could keep the same package and reduce my total by Â£50 a month. GREAT. Except that they still charged me Â£144 for my package and then when I wouldn't pay for a sim extra Â£22 they sent the Â£22 bill to a debt collector after just 30 days. This is where they despite being paid Â£144 a month for the rest of my services decided they wanted two Bill's in advance again. Are you confused yet? Because I was. This is so I have to keep using their services for another two months and perhaps in the hope that I will calm down. Really feel they should be investigated. Their staff apparently cannot switch accounts on or transfer calls to customer care unless the amount on the screen is paid. Whether that amount is wrong or not. Worst provider... I dont care how fast your broadband service is or if you can get me all the champions league matches ... for what you're charging I can get club season tickets flights and accommodation and there's noway it costs you anywhere near that ammount to run these services. This doubling up on billing is a joke. Do you give your staff their wages in advance? I doubt it. Enough said.. I'm no longer paying Virgin media for the privilege of recieving this pain in the backside every other month.  No longer under contract.",3.0

1168,"Promising promises at the beginning when you sign a contract. Then everything goes wrong. Since the first week of my 12 months contract, I had an issue with the broadband. I was making written complains and had to call them for the first 2 months. The broadband was unstable, cutting me off the internet constantly. Some evenings, when you come back after work back home, you could not use the internet as there was an issue with the signal (Virgin has admitted it). And that lasts for weeks. I never received compensation for that ether can't use internet for days but they charged me for the full amount even thou I ask for the partial refund). After few first months of beeing with Virgin and having an issue with the signal, they don't even bother to send the engineer to check my connection, to check the router or whatsover to solve this.After 2 months of everyday complains by me, they send me an email explaining that there is nothing wrong with the internet and that I have a right to seek an advice by the independent company. So I decided to just wait for the end of my 12 months contract and look for another broadband provider. The instructions on how to end the contract are not clear on the Virgin website. It says that if you have a 12 months contract, you don't need to do anything, just give them a call at the end of your contract. But when I called them, they say that I need to give them 30 days' notice. Which wasn't advertised. They suggest me to read the fine print.  More issues raises with my last bill. When I gave them a 30 days notice, I received the bill for the full month (because I was late with my notice, the amount should be for 21 days, not for 31 days of that month). So I called them again. I've spoken with the customer service, and the agent agrees with me and she promised to me that the final amount will be recalculated and sent to me. Which I never received. Just before the disconnection of the services, I have received the same bill again (of Â£44.50) plus the bill stated that my next bill is on the way for the amount of Â£96. Now that is ridiculous. I called them again... the agent this time ensures me that this is a mistake and that they will correct the bill and will send me the next day. The very next day I have received a bill for Â£96 instead of Â£30 (because Â£44.50 was for a full month from 1st till 31st. I used services from 1st till 21st, the amount should be ~Â£30. That what agent agrees and ensure me). So instead of Â£30 once again I received the bill for the amount of Â£96. THAT IS TRIPLED! And that is after the correction?!  I am still fighting for my rights at the moment! My suggestion - avoid Virgin media by any means, there are better broadband providers than this. The customer service is pathetic. The broadband is pathetic as well. Been using many different providers and Virgin is one of the worst ever!!  If you in a similar situation - don't be afraid to fight for your rights! You can ask for professional help at resolver.co.uk Do not trust empty promises before you sign a contract. You will be hooked and will never receive a services that you were hoping for, the customer service is careless.

They reduced the bill from over Â£100 to Â£36.I honestly believe if I had not called I would have still had an incorrect final bill. 3.

They were advertising a great deal for new customers. I had been with Virgin for 10 years and was told that new customer offer was only available once per household. Despite me telling Virgin Media that I was unemployed and was looking for ways to reduce my monthly outgoings, I was twice offered a new deal that would be more than I was already paying. A clear indication that they were not listening to me. I re-requested that they give me their best deal. The âbestâ they could do was nearly double the new customer offer I mentioned earlier. I declined their offers and said I would be looking for an alternative provider. I was out of contract and was free to leave. âGoodâ DealsI did some research and found what looked like a fairly good deal with Plusnet. Contacted Plusnet, I accepted their deal and agreed an installation date. I called Virgin Media back to confirm that I wanted to leave. After trying again to sell me a new âbetterâ deal and then realising they couldnât come close to the price from Plusnet. I told them I wanted my phone number transferred to the new service provider and a member of the Virgin Media team talked me through the service termination and phone number export process. I agreed to their âminimum 30-dayâ termination clause, making my last day with Virgin Media day 13 September. I was told by Virgin Media that only live phone numbers can be exported, so they would leave my phone service as active until after the export had completed. The other services (TV and broadband) would be set to end on 13 September as agreed. I new service was due to go live with Plusnet on 11 September, so this date seemed to provide a good overlap, in case there were any hiccups. HiccupsOn 29 August, my broadband and TV service stopped working. I called Virgin Media to ask for help. I was told that my service was terminated âas agreedâ, when Plusnet issues the phone number export request on 29 August. I said that was not what I agreed and was told, but Virgin insisted that there was nothing they could do to turn my TV and broadband services back on until the previously agreed date of 13 September. Virgin suggested I ask Plusnet if they could bring the installation date forward. I called Plusnet and was told they could not move the date forward, as there were not free slots before 11 September. I called Virgin back and spoke to a more friendly individual, who did some research and said she could request a reconnection, she would need to fill in some forms and it would take up to 72 hours. 72 HoursCan and went, still not service, another called to Virgin Media, another unhelpful team member. The only option to get the service back is to if I âcancel the export and revert back to Virgin Mediaâ as my service provider. If I do that, I get my service back in around 3 days, but I will lose my phone number, forever. I decide not to do this and the issue to be escalated. âIt wonât helpâ to escalate my issue Iâm told by the Virgin Media team member. I ask to speak with her supervisor. No that canât be done either. I ask for a formal complaint to be raised. In a later phone call, I am told that a Virgin Media team member in the âExport teamâ made the mistake that caused my service to be terminated 14 days earlier than agreed. No responseStill heard nothing about anything except a few curt, apparently automated, emails telling me to send back their equipment or I will be charged. I sent back all their equipment 13 days prior to the most recent demanding email, so I call Virgin Media again, to be told âwe know the equipment is on its wayâ, but the system takes 10 working days to notify them of this. I suggest they should change the tone of their emails if the biggest delay in the process is caused by their internal system communication. I was treated like it was my fault that a Virgin Media internal system takes 10 days to notify another Virgin Media team. And Virgin Media isnât responsible if an automated email causes upset. If an email sent by Virgin Media to a Virgin Media customer causes upset, whose fault it then? It must be my fault; I mean I am the customer. Based on my previous experience this should have been obvious, my mistake. 45 DaysMoving on to more pleasant things then, the Virgin Media team member Iâm speaking with tells me my refund cheque with me mailed to me within the next 45 days. I ask for clarification, âDid you say 4 to 5 days?â The reply was a definite âNo, 45 daysâ. Forty-five days to send me a refund cheque. What The ****? They have to be kidding me, right? No, it turns out Iâm silly for thinking otherwise. Apparently, 45 days is normal and acceptable. The only thingThe only thing that takes longer than the time Virgin Media take to respond to complaints is how long it will take them to send a refund! This is not actually true, as I havenât received any communication from Virgin Media about my complaint yet, so donât know how long I will have to wait for that, but I wonât be at all surprised if itâs longer than 45 days!",2.0

Then, after your fixed term runs out, they start bombarding you with bi-annual unjustifiable price increases, and when you threaten to leave them, they offer you a ""discount"", which seems nice at first, but after a couple of years with this network provider you realise that you have to spend approx 45 minutes every six months on the phone with these morons to stop them from extorting you.

They overcharge/charge for random things, but woe betide you if you try to resolve it. I'd imagine I'm somewhere around Â£300 out of pocket for constant errors you cannot resolve. You can ring & get one result, but call about the same issue & get a completely contradictory response, usually resulting in them trying to charge you again. I have never once had a decent experience with them, and am so glad I left for Sky. I tried to contact the complaints department and the contact box never even transferred to an agent! It's appalling that such a huge company would have 0.4/10 & not do a single thing to resolve it - tells you all you need to know about their customer care vs money grabbing. Eurgh, they've been an absolute nightmare from start to finish, & by the end I was paying Â£10 extra for a bill than the deal I initially signed up for & was 'guaranteed' indefinitely.

Since then their service has become well beyond terrible.I have spent hours on the telephone wasted to somebody who calls them selves Mark, Jane, Peter and so on, who does not have the slightest grasp of English , who seem to go out of their way to be unhelpful.This company has become so bad that I am totally bewildered why Sir Richard Branson allows the Virgin brand to be used.They add in little extras onto the bills without telling you, and when you try and find out why, you will spend hours arguing and not get any answers. If you do you won't understand them. When we were moving and had to cancel or change address on every service we had, about 90% of our time was taken up by our dealings with Virgin Media. I ended up ripping out their equipment and carting it  into their last remaining shop in the area (as they have closed them all down) and dumping it on the shop counter.

Apparently it's too complicated to put the option to leave on the website.- I was overcharged on my final bill. Not only do they not properly notify you, they do not reimburse you automatically. Unless you notice and go through the same process of calling of trying to call them, your money is gone.- I have them 5-6 weeks notice before my move. They failed to send the box for returning the equipment. One month after moving address I get threatening emails that I will be charged Â£40 of I don't return it.

1264,"I've been with VM for over 11 years. In that time, I think the internet has gone down only a handful of times and it has been consistently very fast.  The reason I'm leaving them is cost. I'm basically on their minimum package but still getting charged Â£60 a month for 70Mbps internet. That may be reasonable value, but I just don't need that speed. And they're unable, or unwilling, to offer me anything less. Trying to actually leave them has been fairly stressful. You can't cancel on their website, or via email. Nor do they make their postal address readily available. You have to go through their awful call centre. If you go through the menu to leave VM, you'll be put on hold for half an hour and then get through to someone who can't actually perform the task that the menu took you too. They then put you through to their retentions department - another half hour wait.  After countless attempts to actually talk to someone who would cancel the service, and failing, I ended up finding their postal address on the VM forum, and sending a cancellation via recorded delivery. It's one thing to try and encourage customers to stay, I was initially quite willing to be persuaded, but after this experience I can't wait to be rid of them. They seem intent to obstruct you from leaving, and they do it in a ""you can't do that"" rather than ""what can we do to make you stay"" sort of way. Got a BT line installed the other day.

Sent letters (by recorded delivery) and also contacted another broadband provider.  It seems when the other provider contacted VM to transfer my telephone number the disconnections/retentions dept became involved- they offered me a decent package at a reasonable price and I was tempted to stay - I queried if the cancellation letters I had sent would affect anything and was assured that if I agreed to a new contract then they would not take effect.  GUESS WHAT - go away on holiday and aware of a problem, so contact VM to find out that whilst I have been away my services have been cancelled from my letter!  I spent over an hour on the phone trying to get my services re-instated - no form of apology - they admitted there was a recent contract but no notes on the system to say to ignore my cancellation letter so the service had been cancelled.  They would happily set up a new contract but at a higher price than I had agreed- of course I refused and demanded to have the agreed contract re-instated - got passed between several members of their staff to be told the same thing - asked to speak to a manager - was told I was going to be put through, then the same person came back and told me the manager would say the same thing!

When it works the WiFi signal is shocking in a small house it's down to dial up speed upstairs, the customer service team suggest WiFi boosters which really shouldn't be needed as my old router was absolutely fine. I've been palmed off for over a year by them, eventually had an engineer come out and discover there's a fault on my cable and it's been there since I took out my package. That doesn't cure the shocking WiFi signal (lots online about the hub 3.0 having shocking signal) I can't wait to have it took out in 2 months it's been a massive disappointment, the customer service team are so bad it's almost like they're trying to be terrible they'll hang up on you if they can't palm you off with nonsense. After a year they've finally sent someone out to fix something that they were told about a year ago but just palmed me off. For how much it costs I'm amazed they think a solution to fix the bad WiFi reception on the hubs is to install WiFi boosters around my 3 bed semi so it's usable when previous cheap routers have been perfect.",2.0

Over the past year we have had on 2 occasions a technician come out to âfixâ the service and both times we have been left with a worse connection and service. To start with the price is constantly rising as if it wasnât extortionally expensive already. They say the price is rising so they can give you a âbetter qualityâ of service which is a total lie! They just con you out of paying more and more money. You do not get the type of service you pay for. When it actually works the WiFi is reasonably fast, but half the time it does not have an internet connection. It is totally unreliable. When there is more than 3 devices using the WiFi it becomes incredibly slow even though we are paying to be able to use 5+ devices at high speed. Considering we donât live in a mansion you wouldâve thought the connection would be able to reach every room in the house, no. The WiFi connection Is only available in the living room the router is in, the room directly above it, and the kitchen directly next to it. This leaves 3 rooms without a connection. Since we pay in excess of Â£60 you would of thought it would be able to reach every room in the house which are not far from the router at all. On top of this the online and telephone customer service is SHOCKING! Not a single person I spoke to seemed to actually want to help out with your problem, they basically told us if we didnât like what we got, bugger off somewhere else!! Oh by the way, this was after calling multiple times and every time being put on hold for almost 40 minutes! If you have to wait that long to be able to speak to someone who âdeals with technical problemsâ or who âdeals with cancelling accountsâ there is clearly A LOT of unhappy high paying customers. Also, when you finally get through to speak to someone, it is very difficult to understand them as none of them seem to be able to speak proper English and you spend most your time repeating yourself or getting them to repeat themselves. There is no long term customer loyalty. Before we started having these problems in the past year, we have been with virgin media for probably 10 years and we have received no rewards, discounts or upgrades on deals whatsoever. The price just keeps on rising! When we very first joined we mustâve of been paying around Â£30 for amazing service, and now itâs done a complete 360. We pay over double the amount for the worst possible service you could ask for. after trying to get a hold of service teams for 4 days, we have finally been able to happily CANCEL our account with them and joined with EE broadband who have offered us a super fast WiFi deal at nearly half the price.

No manners, no idea of what customer service is, they basically don't care! Our virgin media services were disconnected in March 2019 and we were expecting a cheque of Â£42.96. I have been following it up with Virgin Media and was told to wait for 60 days from 24.04.19 as cheque takes 60 days to process.  I called Virgin Media again on 05.07.19 and was told that the cheque was sent to a different address (that we lived at 4 years ago). I was then told to go to that address and get the cheque as this is the address that I had given for any correspondence. I tried to explain that services were not provided at that address but our current address and we no longer live at that address, so cheque should be sent to our current address.  Absolutely no apologies from the customer service representative who said that it is not a mistake but miscommunication and asked me to ring next week to sort it out with another team.  Asked to be put through to a Manager- spoke to Mushtak who repeated the same thing and blamed me for providing wrong correspondence address (which I never had, why would I?). I asked Mushtak how I can complain- he said that he is the Manager and will deal with complaints. Asked him how I can contact his senior Manager- was told that he cant provide details- he is the one who will deal with this. I said to him that I don't want him to deal with this but he still would not give me any information re: escalation process. Don't understand what is the point of asking all the security information including address on the phone when the cheque is still sent to a previous address. Absolutely appalled by the the customer service and their attitude towards their customers.

Last year in March I moaned about the cost and my monthly bill went fromÂ£59 to Â£25 monthly for phone and 200M broadband. The reliability has always been poor and WiFi always patchy but with the router on a shelf upstairs itâs just ok.This March I called as my bill had jumped to Â£44 monthly and ended up cancelling my phone service however I had the rudest operator I have ever spoken to who dropped my call before completing the transaction. Next think, the line got swapped to another provider and someone at Virgin decided I didnât need my broadband either so switched it off. After six calls and several hour wait, three operators promised to reconnect me and apologised for their mistake. Still didnât happen so I called yet again and was told some cock and bull story about OFCOM rules and an 8 day wait to start reconnection even though itâs Virgins fault not mine.Cancelled the direct debit so they can whistle and BT installing this week for free. This would have been bad normally but I had a very major cancer op when our telephone and broadband were off so had lots of additional stress caused by Virgin.

The only way to reset this is to cancel (again) - really cancel, and then wait for them to call back a few days later with much reduced rates. In our case down to Â£12/month. But obviously this will revert again after another 12 months. If you're prepared to go through this hoop every 12 months, good luck to you. For me, this is indicative of their attitude to their customers. See what they can get away with. Make you go through hoops to bring the rate back down. Slide it back up again afterwards. Not an attitude I'm happy with. Secondly, the actual router/modem/internet service was poor. Often dropping out or running slowly.

Due to work commitments we arranged for family to come over to be present when the engineer arrived. I received a call at work saying the engineer would be late arriving at 17.00. At 17.46 I received a text saying the service visit was now on hold while Virgin investigated a network problem. (A whole day wasted for our family members who kindly offered to help). Called Virgin and they offered little explanation as to the cause of the problem only that it was being worked on and they predicted it will be resolved around 01.30 a.m. When I asked how we would be compensated for lack of service they offered Â£5 deduction to our next bill which I said was unexceptionable due to the inconvenience of waiting in all day for an engineer no show. Having been put on hold for what seemed like an eternity they eventually came back with the offer of a Â£10 deduction to our next bill. Later that evening I received a text to say the issue was now resolved, please restart your equipment and wait 30 min. (Which I did). No change still no service.... Again called customer service to get no real help. More trouble shooting which I had already done with countless other customer service reps only to be told they needed to send an engineer to site to investigate further. Having explained the situation again and again and again, we found ourselves right back to where we started with the earliest an engineer could come to site being the start of the following week leaving us without service for 3 and a half days...... I asked how we would now stand to be compensated for the additional lack of service and was told we had been compensated by the system to the maximum level for amount of days without service.  When I asked to be put through to the manager I was transferred but no one answered the call transfer, there was just background office noise. Had to hang up and ring back explaining the  situation again for about the seventh time and again asked to speak to a manager. I was told they were busy and would call back. I said I would wait and they insisted they were too busy to talk and only offered a call back.

Spoke with a lovely lady, was sent a final bill, paid that and returned equipment. They kept billing me as if that hadnât happened. I called them to point this out - after every bill. Got through to different countries each time (I donât have a problem with offshore customer service but it became apparent I was speaking to a different country each time - no wonder they canât communixate) . Always on hold for ages, always ended with them saying they didnât know what had happened but theyâd sent orders for it to be cancelled now (except on one occasion when I was just left on hold for an hour). Escalated by February to texts and phone calls demanding money. Iâve called three times since then and tried to use their text service twice. No luck, and rudeness on the text service (itâs not a smart service or anything - just a random guy texting who seems to have no knowledge or power to escalate). Iâm worried that the next step is bailiffs or debt collectors - frequency of calls is escalating. And all for bills sent months after I cancelled the service!

I said I had done this already prior to calling and it only provided a temporary solution. I was told to do it again and that the problem would be resolved. SÃ¬gnal dropped 30 mins later. Call 2 at 8pm - after being put on hold for a few minutes i was told the service would be back on shortly but they would not give me a time. I told them how important internet was because I work from home and they told me it would be fixed shortly. I was promised a manager would call me back but I received no call back. Service came back on 2 hrs later at 10 pm.The next day I lost internet at exactly the same time in the evening. Call 3 at 8pm - I called up and asked what was going on I was told there was an area fault and that there was nothing they could do until it was fixed. A new story. I said this was unacceptable and demanded to speak to a manager as an uninterrupted service was key for my work. Again I was promised a call but nothing. The next day I had no internet at all and could not work. My wife had to go to a relatives house to get WiFi to work. Call 4 at 8.30 - told the guy on first line support to forget about even trying to start a conversation with me and to put me straight through to a manager. After some resistance he put me through to the most useless of people that I had spoken to in Virgin. He told me that there was an area fault and that it would not be fixed for 8 days and there was nothing he could do, I was not offered a solution. Even though I did not care about compensation (as it was uninterrupted service I needed) I was not offered anything. The worst was that he told me that he could offer me nothing but tell me I had to wait 8 days for the service to resume. I politely told him this was unacceptable and that I would be cancelling my service. Call 5 at 9am - I called cancellations as spoke to a uk department and when asked for the reason I told them it was due to Virgin not committing to the service defined in the contract. Now I donât know who was ********** me because cancellations told me the area fault was with tv (which I did not subscribe to) and not broadband. He told me he would get an engineer out tomorrow and resolve the issue. I subsequently called BT to subscribe to infity my previous provider as I never had any problems with I just though I would try Virgin as it was cheaper for a quicker service.

I have two teenage sons both of whom have naturally increased their internet use over the course of the years I was with Virgin. Both are gamers both like to stream movies, what teenager doesn't. That's where the issues started with this all singing fancy broadband (they claim) Firstly the signal off their VIVID 350 and the Hub 3 is at best weak in upstairs rooms, then add to this the way they apply the fair use policy which involves limiting speeds to below snail pace at weekends when you need it most of all and you get a below standard expensive service.Virgin claim unlimited downloads at high speed, what they don't tell you is they will restrict your service if your a high end user. Now I only found this out when I was leaving Virgin as the girl on the phone let slip that we may have been restricted because of our usage. We were finding 3 weekends out of four the internet seldom worked never mind being restricted and when it was working it was desperately slow.What I find highly amusing now is that the female customer services rep in their cancellation department arrogantly suggested that our use would be subject to restrictions with all other service providers. well here's the thing, I have been with BT for two years now and not only can I get a good signal from their hub all over the house but I also haven't been subject to fair use policy and my lads have only increased their use as have I.

They also make it difficult to get in touch to leave so the best way to get in touch with them is to go onto the website and say you are a new customer - They soon pick up the phone for a chat then !

And having phoned their tech line several times (which is no longer UK based, so had to sit through a solid hour each time listening to somebody speaking pigeon-English very slowly taking me through their step-by-step guide for restarting or switching channels on the router) and having written a formal letter of complaint and almost begging them to send an engineer to check the local box or my line, they sent me a letter saying they were sorry that I was ""unhappy"" with my service, but they legally do not guarantee internet speeds.  It's sad. I was with Virgin for years and didn't mind paying the higher price because the connection was superb, the UK based help centres were always very helpful, and engineer visits were free.

It took an engineer visit to sort this out and the connect started late. As if this wasn't bad enough, during the sales call I was assured I could add a phone line on later on, bringing the total cost of services to Â£42 per month. I called literally 3 days later to act upon this agreement and found they wanted a Â£25 activation fee for the line, and they wouldn't honour the agreed price and wanted to up my charges to Â£43.75 per month. As my father says, it's the big companies you have to watch out for these days.

1629,"Joined via an official virgin media door to door salesman in October 2018. Salesman offered me 50mb broadband, Anytime landline calls, TV player bundle and free sky sports for 3 months â all for Â£32 per month. It sounded like a great deal so I even got a friend to sign up via the same salesman. The numerous problems started from the get-go, I will list it out for easier reading. 1. I repeatedly told the salesman that I have never had virgin media before whilst signing a pre contract in my house. Salesman still went ahead and booked the wrong type of installation (Engineer thought I had a virgin line already installed). So I got a new installation date for 2 weeks later, had to call my previous provider to extend the notification period which was tricky. 2. Also mentioned to the salesman, that I wanted the router to go into my bedroom due to my PC and gaming set ups needing an Ethernet connection and to keep my existing landline number. Salesman promised it can be done. Installation day comes (second time around), engineer immediately dictates where the best place for the router to go ignoring my preference. Engineer made so many excuses not to put it in my bedroom, probably because of the extra work needed, so I gave up and it ended up going in the living room alongside the TV box (I bought a powerline extender for Â£50 just to connect my pc). After the installation, I then find out that my landline number has been changed, I was really frustrated because I have had that number for many years and was looking to keep it. 3. This is where it becomes even darker, I was getting a bit concerned in why I wasnât getting any emails as you do when you join a new provider and I wanted to make an online account. So I called up the customer helpline and they told me itâs because your email was incorrect .com instead of .co.uk. It was written clearly correct on the pre-contract paper handed to me by the salesman, to my shock my friend also had the same problem. 4. Then out of curiosity I told the customer service guy to read out my package and lo and behold I was on a different package weekend calls and nothing about 3 monthsâ free sky sports, it was just a normal package offered online. My friend did the same and got the same outcome, even the email situation .com instead of .co.uk 5. I rang the salesman and he kept lying about it just being a mistake and it will be sorted out (basically he was trying to run down my 14 day cooling off period). He eventually stopped answering calls from me and my friend. I then spoke to a manager from the customer services and he agreed that there was some mis-selling going on and will honour what I was promised if I sent a copy of the pre-contract to his email, which I then did. He then replied that everything was sorted, far from the truth as I saw no change on my account. 6. The last straw, I called again, really wanted to cancel it as I was fed up and 3 days away from the cooling off period. Was told the same thing by a different manager honour the contract etc. I then look at my account again and I see that my first bill is Â£120 including 50-pound installation fee when I was promised free installation. The 2 managers basically messed up my package beyond repair. 7. I then called up to cancel it finally, had to repeat my story every time I called by the way. Advisor said that I donât have to pay a penny because the cancellation is within the 14 day cooling off period. No surprise here, they then sent me a bill a week after cancelling of Â£75 for god knows what reason, had to make further calls to customer service to sort this out, they said it was a mistake donât worry etc.In Summary a had 2-3 weeks of hell, I was a loyal and happy Sky customer before virgin, I got mis-sold by a sly Virgin Salesman called âKevinâ apparently who lied, the customer service from virgin is also appalling most probably due to untrained employees in the Indian call centre, on top of all this the broadband service went down for 2 days in my area during my few days with virgin. At the end had to re-join Sky.

As said, we contracted them for Â£30.00 per month and that bill ended up at Â£80.00 a month. We carried on for 2 months more and changed the service to a different broadband company. To sum up, I basically do not recommend Virgin Media to no one as it will be an utter waste of money and time. PS.

I found an alternative (local, and Â£50.00 a month cheaper) and phoned Virgin to cancel. It took them 35 minutes for a human being to answer, and another ten minutes for me to be connected to the correct person. The person I got must have got out of bed the wrong side. I informed her how long I had been waiting. She said she was not interested in that. She was rude and was as unhelpful as she could be. I stressed when I spoke to her that I wanted my telephone number ported over to my new provider. My new internet provider contacted me to say that they couldnât port my number over because I hadnât told Virgin I wanted that done, despite the fact that I had made it crystal clear to the advisor that that was what I wanted. This necessitated another phone call and another 45-minute wait. The person I got this time assured me that my number would be ported over. The next day I got an e-mail welcoming me to my new Virgin phone service. If it wasnât so serious it would be laughable. Not wanting to have to wait another 45 minutes before speaking to an unhelpful telephone âadvisorâ, I wrote a letter. I got a fairly prompt reply assuring me that all was in hand. They stated that they had tried to contact me by phone. It turned out that three silent phone calls received and interpreted as nuisance calls were actually from them. In a subsequent phone call, that wasnât silent, I was assured that I would get a refund of Â£62.84 that was overpaid because my contract ended half way through a payment period. My contract ended on 25th August. It is now 5th October and I am still waiting. The impression I get from this awful experience is that Virgin Media make it as difficult as possible to cancel their services.

1691,"OK so this is now a part two of three I guess, my first was a couple of days ago, and an engineer has come out since then. Long story short, all was fine for 3 weeks, then for almost a week the system was working only at 12mbps anywhere really, then just literally minutes before the engineer slot was to happen, it jumped up to 80mbps in the living room (hub location) only. It fell back to 12mbps.  2 hours later, the system again jumped up to 80mbps in the living room and a better but paltry 30mbps in the kitchen, twelve feet of open doors away. Five minutes later, the engineer said he would be there in 5 minutes.  I know, right?! Engineer does his bit, discovers two faulty connections, and as a result of one the phone began working. The eventual decision to change the hub box seemed moot, as it behaved in the same, better, but changeable fashion. Here is the upshot of the visit:- faulty phone connection sorted- faulty/not fully plugged-in fibre connection pushed fully home- wifi began behaving as follows: Cyclical, seemed to go fast then slow in cycles of a few minutes.  I began to think virgin had a special way of throttling, that did not choke the data speed to a fixed low level, but cycled it high/low for five minutes each. Hitherto, I was able to treat power of wifi as inter-related with speed in mbps.  IE if we had 4 arcs of wifi, your speed was good. The virgin system is not like that.  I have wifi boosted it to heck and back, and it still just permits 12mbps.  this is too clever to be by accident - 12mbps just about permits HD video but of course the BBC iplayer, has dreadful and unusable lag at these speeds. 12 feet, and the signal has to take a left turn into our kitchen...dead.  From 87mbps, to 68mbps in the lobby then 14mbps in the kitchen. I find the entire matter confusing.  I think, there IS throttling of some type occurring, BUT another component has become apparent - I need to make use of my old ASUS 68 router it seems, that I used to avert all the BT hub problems we had, for similar reasons. Virgin in common with BT, seem to meddle regularly with their hubs/wifi units.  So, in short, the advice is to get into your virgin hub (xxx.xxx.x.x address you can google it) use the password off the bottom of the hub unit, and set it to : MODEM mode. Now, the virgin unit does not do wifi.  Now, you can use a decent unit to do that with, and ASUS certainly is an improvement.  It has aerials and stuff. So now, I will be able to deal with a known quantity, that won't update unless I make it, and the virgin unit just acts as a modem, not modem and router/hub. Basically, someone else online has a video and all they did apart from the settings thing, making virgin box modem only, was take a rj-45 and cat 5e or 6 cable, from virgin box to asus router. That's as far as my planning has got.  Part three, will be when I have solved this, by actually implementing a solution of the type outlined above. Setting the virgin hub to modem only, is by logging in to that xxx... address as above, then putting in the password on the bottom of the hub unit of virgin's, then it is in 'advanced' I think, or 'router' or something to set it to modem only. Back later with results, I cannot fathom a company producing the most advanced infrastructure in the company then lumbering customers with a creaky under-powered microwave unit (that's what wifi is). I also saw a guy advise on how to pump up the power of a BT hub to reach anywhere through walls galore, but my brother said ' You sleep right beside that hub don't you bro?' I think he was implying my brain would get fried.  I bought the ASUS and put tin foil behind it instead.  Part three later then...",2.0

1701,"Well, shucks, don't I wish I had read these reviews first. This is the end of September 2018, and about two weeks ago we had our Virgin installation and for about ten days it was almost incident-free bar some restarts out of nowhere, and my 'ookla' speedtest app on the ipad recorded 70mbps. That is the good news over. The entire town has been ringing to the sound of two-stroke stone cutters as pavement after pavement has a slot dug and fibre cable laid.  Now, I could carp and say as I am no longer full-time employed, this ruined the best summer weather-wise I can remember...but at 200mbps promised, it seemed churlish. Now, two warnings arose as the salesman pressed us - one, he did keep saying 'megabytes' to describe the speed.  It is rated in megabits per second or mbps for short. Two, he was not actually all that keen to flog us the 200mbps, preferring to labour on about cost savings per month and the 100mbps package. I will save you wondering why - when I called yesterday saying my 200mbps had dumped to 12mbps for the last 48 hours for no reason I could find, the obfuscation and lack of clear or helpful tech support came shining through. I did have to be pretty rude at times to for example, not accept the techies view that it was important I wasn't in the same room - I explained it was ten feet and an open door. He wouldn't shut up, motored on with a rapid wordage and accent that I could not figure at times.  I literally had to let it all float over me and just say what needed said at the end.  It was motormouth like sales patter is when it is flannel. He said it was the hub needed settings changed.  I was agape.  'Let me be clear, you want me to log into my hub and put the password in to make technical adjustments?!' I said absolutely gobsmacked. Yup, he wanted me to start adjusting widths of channels for the wifi. I stopped him.  NO I said.  The tv apps started to show a buffer circle, and then I went to the ipad app to check speeds on the line. The tv is hardwired into the virgin kit by the engineer.  It is all cables, I said.  All together.  It all worked and my app showed 70mbps until Wednesday midnight or so. It has crunched since then. I left BT because of incompetent technical support and installations botched.  (They used an old alarm cable - no really - to put the 70mbps signal through.  For the technical, it's got no shielding and it's only good for phone calls.  I installed it pre-broadband FFS.  It has no markings like cat 5 or cat 6 or cat V so the BT guy ought to have known.  Upshot - 8 months of intermittent failure and changing parts in my PC until I found out what the muppet had done. Anyway....I fixed that, and we just had to tolerate the very average mbps thereafter.) Back to Virgin...we have a tech appointment booked.  Now, Rakesh on the phone, said it is a hub that needs replaced.  I know this is unlikely.  I say, Virgin have throttled us back after a ten-day honeymoon, and it's gone to heck since half the town switched to Virgin, following the outrageous promises and the summer installing. I am an IT specialist.  It's not the box, unless the box has an emergency backstop to go to 13mbps or so, which it has now defaulted to, because some part is fried. Rakesh said initially it was an auto adjust patch of software that had failed to work properly, hence the manual attempt to make changes.   Blah blah. Not happy...I can smell what's coming, I will not have 11 months of this before bailing.  BT was better than this, even if it did take an ever-increasing sum of money and 18 months to get stable.  Oh, plus I got a good ASUS hub with three aerials, and a piece of tin foil behind that, to magnify/focus the wifi forward - it works. So here's the obvious rule emerging - it costs Â£1 per mbps to get broadband that's good, along with a phone line etc. per month. We are on a 200mbps with Virgin and the best I saw was 70mbps for ten days.  At half price of Â£34 per month - there you go, if it works, it is only 70mbps not 200 but that's good enough, and surprise, Â£1 per single mbps.  BT ended up at about Â£67 per month for 40mbps to 73mbps. They only came up once Virgin started digging and stone-cutting. This broadband lying thing, is so commonplace, not even regulators expect or can enforce anything else. The practical fix for us is to go back to BT and using the freeview channels on an ancient skybox and satellite dish. My problem is even if Virgin fixed this on Monday, at the tech appointment, I have no confidence until ten days or so are up, and if it plunges, that will likely be it for me. I don't want to argue all day with a tech guy I cannot understand.  I don't believe they know what they are doing, and they seemed pretty able to fob-off.  Were I less forceful or less knowledgeable, they might have told me it was ok, and signed me off when they tried to get me to watch the tv app and if it was ok, say all was good. Unpleasant, patronising, circular, I just find this tiresome, this broadband baloney.  I buy a car, I expect a 2 litre to be 1998cc at least.  Don't sell me broadband quoting 200mbps, lie about the faults that arise, then try and make me wear the 5% of that service I get soon after install. No, it won't do.",2.0

He kept telling me no discount possible but I hadn't asked for a discount, I was querying my previous bills. He them proceeded to give me a postal address to send my correspondence to.

Needless to say, the visit was declined. I accrued one and a half hours on hold on the phone after 6pm, just trying to find out where the tech was, without success.

I explained that no one has time to check every bill and confirm it against direct debits, in the same way that no one has time to read every term and condition before they sign up to anything.  He agreed but still refused to cancel the late charges.  If anyone had told me they were cancelling the direct debit (in any form of communication) I would have set up a new one.They have no idea how to retain customer goodwill.

1722,"I live in area 21, our Internet has been intermittently down for 6 months (yes... SIX MONTHS!). There has been an snr issue for over 6 months that virgin has failed to resolve. They have given fake estimated times of resolution which are never met, month after month we are assured that the Internet will be resolved by a given date. After that date, the Internet still drops. We receive drops outs of over 10 hours (the longest was 16 hours). The customer service is horrendous, they don't even (at minimum) call the people affected to even attempt to explain the matter. It's a whole post code that is affected yet that isn't a priority (the level of priority of P4. P1 is the highest level of priority, up to p6 I believe) We are not given even compensation for the utter inconvenience of over half a year of intermittent Internet. They just reimburse us for the time the Internet was down. If I go to a shop and buy something, or pay for a service and that service isn't acceptable, at bare minimum you are reimbursed with what you should have gotten, plus atleast store credit, ATLEAST. Virgin, with their horrendous customer service, have said they can only pay back the money for the down time. (to put that into perspective, if you pay 30 pounds a month for Internet, if your Internet is down for 24 hours, so one whole day, regardless of you having to eat I to your minutes calling them, then they put you in a queue and bounce you around for an hour, regardless of you having to use your own Internet, run out, purchase more Internet, regardless of the inconvenience that it caused if your whole family (a family of 5 in the house, all who use Internet) having to spend extra money in this fashion, regardless of deadlines you need to meet, research you need to do, personal things you want to watch online, coursework that needs to be completed, jobs that need to be applied to, YOU GET Â£1 BACK!! ONE POUND. For all of your troubles, you get a pound back. It's outrageous. You may question why we are still with virgin, it's because we have been promised time and time again that by a certain date the Internet will be fine and we will receive no issues after that. This has happened 4/5 times. It's disgusting, and virgin have not even reached a hand out in apology.  This is not the only issue. Although it is a major issue, they are also deceivers. Treacherous liars. They called us a few months back saying we needed to change our contract we had with them, threw a bunch of big fancy words at us and said our contract is ending and we need to change our to another, more expensive contract. We're not that dumb. We said we know our contract and we had no specific time frame to keep to. We had the proof to show that, and we didn't pay into a new contract. The next bill of ours went from Â£40 ish pounds to Â£50-Â£60!! So we called them, explained the issue, they apologised and reduced our bill to Â£10 less than our original bill (to Â£30). It's outrageous that such an issue would occur. Moreover, their customer service are so pretentious. I work in IT, I'm a second line engineer, I know my stuff. So when I call, I will speak to the customer service as I would speak to my own colleagues (specifically and precisely, using IT terms the layman may not understand). The customer service team, almost every time I call, as I speak they cut me off, they raise their voice over mine, they don't listen to me and continue talking as if what I'm mentioning makes no difference, at times they would speak rudely once they realise I'm not budging and will say my piece.  We have changed our router roughly 4 times. Virgin insisted the issue we faced (almost 7 months ago) was due to our router. After the 2nd time, we realised that this is a bigger issue than just our router. We mentioned to virgin that there is a bigger issue, to which they replied that they cannot do anything further than changing our router and checking the cables unless others in the area call up that their Internet is also down. One of the technicians came (quite fortunately) at the time of the Internet being down. He sat there confused as to why it was down. He plugged in another router ""just in case"" and we waited... Still no Internet. He was confused and said he's not sure what the issue is. A few months later they said there was an SNR issue (single noise reduction issue. Which is basically a faulty wire that sends data back up to the router in the back of everything and causes the problems I mentioned). So now that they know the issue, the fix is simple yet tedious. Find the wire if they hired me, ran me through things and gave me the equipment, I'd do it myself! But they can't even find the root cause of the issue, all these months later, nothing.  If a person wants an Internet service provider, don't go to virgin. Their amazing speed that they have means nothing whatsoever if you can't make use of it P.s... My Internet right now is down My area reference is 21 and my account number is 666078401",2.0

I went to a virgin store where they still cannot find me, although i got a letter that my direct debit has been setted up!!!From the store they gave another number to call, which I did, and when finally spoke to them after another 20+ minutes of waiting, they transferred me to another department which after 20 more minutes of waiting they just hung up on me!These Virgin guys are amazingly big liers and all they care is how to grab your money, even for services they won't provide, which basically is stealing!!!!!!!Of course not even a word for refund or any form of compensation so far...AVOID VIRGIN IN ANY COST!",2.0

Later again day before installation I got a call that they found some blockade that they need to deal with, and they'll connect us at 31st.. Got really angry, after few harsh words I heard that they put us on priority list, when asked about discount we heard, that they can't do anything, but we will be connected soon. To make sure that we're finally going to have Internet I asked TalkTalk to connect us as well. Two days before virgin supposed to connect us.. Guess what, I got a call! Again saying that they can't do this on time, and we need to wait until 12th September! That was really bad joke. I said thank you, I want to cancel my appointment and finish agreement.

First issue was getting conflicting messages as to whether they knew there was an issue. Online service checker said it was fine, but automated phone call recognised an issue. Although it recognised an issue, it gave no eta of fix. Found it very difficult to get through to a human to discuss the issue. Most services are automated. Twitter team offer zero practical help, just generic bile. When you do get through to a person itâs an call centre where the staff have no access to in-depth network problems. Just the same old reset the router nonsense. Calling the problem intermittent, itâs not intermittent, it was completely out! Only when threatening to cancel, do you get to speak to someone who knows what they are talking about, which takes on average 45 minutes on hold to get through. The cancellation team are able to give an estimated fix date, but they have given me 2 dates now, both of which have been and gone. They claim the issue is only affecting a handful of houses, probably the reason they have no urgency to fix it. And just to round it off, got a letter through the post today saying the monthly bill is going up from October.",2.0

Files around 2 gig are not big at all. you watch a film on netflix it is around that size so why on earth are these idiots punishing me. 100% I wont be renewing and I will be advising others on their twitter ads to stay away from virgin media.  I suggest everyone that has be wronged by them to join their twitter feed. every time you see them advertising tweets about their services , be sure to comment in about how bad they are with throttling. They really fear this action against them because it essentially means they cant be successful using twitter to get more customers.",2.0
1858,"The internet is ok, as fast as advertised most times, even if quite unreliable, it let me down several times.The dreadful bit is the customer service. Sending email is not allowed, they have a chat which is unavailable 9 times out of 10 and never in the summer, and the wait times on the phone are dreadful.What's really bad, though, is that they tell you one thing and then don't do it.They told me they'd give me a 50Â£ voucher because they never told me they were increasing prices, and they never sent it. They told me my service would be cancelled automatically at the end of the contract, and I only found out this wasn't the case when I received the email that I had payed the month after the contract expired.I'm actually thinking of sueing them, because this is nothing short of a fraud",1.0
1859,"Awful service!Engineers installed cables completely differently as requested, left an eyesore on the driveway. we were then told the cables could not be buried. Connection kept dropping, when it was connected the speed was super slow! Kept calling for them to fix it and they said there was no problem. Engineers were supposed to come out and re-cable but never came, several people came out to 'have a look' but didn't know hat to do, called their managers who kept promising the issue would be fixed, it never was. One day someone even came 8 hours late and I was waiting to go out, when he arrived he said he couldn't do anything so my day was wasted. I managed to finally get through on the phone after various attempted to cancel during my free cancellation period, lost a few days of working from home I was not happy and was told I would not be compensated. Asked when they would be taking the cables away as I cancelled and was told I would have to remove them myself!!! Awful service, avoid at all costs!!",2.0

1861,"Broadband keeps disappearing every evening without a fail from 8 o clock onward. Sundays are bloody nightmares. When I was sold my package they guaranteed that my broadband speed wont fall below 41mb which turned out to be a complete lie. Technicians have been out and I was told that line can handle x amount of people and currently there are three times the amount of people connected to the same line and it cant handle it. Guess what- you will still charged the same amount of money even when you are not getting any services. O, needless to mention that technicians are not sent out in the evenings and weekends when services are overloaded. They can only pay you a visit during the day when broadband is not used as much and speed is relatively reasonable. So to sum it all up...If you want to buy top price Ferrari with a 1.2 litre engine which can only do 25 mph at the most... Go for Virgin!

1863,"I have given one-star for speed and reliability, although I have not yet had time to test these.  This is mainly to re-inforce my one-star for customer service and overall satisfaction.  If possible, I would give this -10.  I placed my order for the Player Package, including Player TV and Weekend Calls but then I upgraded to Anytime Calls.  The advisor told me to choose the self-installation option and the installation date was agreed.  Then Virgin changed the installation date, because an engineer needed to do this.  In the meantime, they had contacted BT with the original installation date and BT were going to stop services on that date.  I found it extremely frustrating, trying to get them to keep to the original date â I went to about 4 departments and, each time, I had a 10 minute wait.  After threatenting to cancel the order, they managed to keep to the original date.  All the advisors I spoke to were based offshore and, although I have been advised that the calls are always dealt with both offshore and in the UK and that the calls just go to the next advisor, I would be interested to know the ratio of offshore to UK staff.  Some of the advisors just failed to appreciate the problem and I believe that one of them gave bad advice, just to pacify me.  When the order arrived,  I found that the advisor had logged the order incorrectly and I received only the WIFI and Phone.  I accept that I should have noticed that this was missing, when the email arrived with the order details, but I didn't.  On the installation date, I spent at least 3 hours trying to get this resolved.  I cut one call off after an hour, so it would not be charged to my bill.  Then I had to go through it all again.  I went to the department that dealt with 'home move leaver', got passed to Customer Services, got put through to Sales and then back to CS.  The original connection took about 20 minutes and then each transfer took about 10 minutes minimum.  My mistake was in selecting 'leaving due to home move', because I did not realise that there was 'leaving for any other reason', which is the one I should have gone to â this is the department that seemed to have any ability to understand and maybe do something to rectify this problem.  It may be co-incidence but I made this connection after 4pm and the advisor was based in the UK. I still had to wait 20 minutes to connect.  Unfortunately, although my account was active, their system had not been updated, so he could not progress any action at that time.  What he did say was that the order logged matched the installation order â in effect, it was my fault for not noticing and following up before installation.  I tried again, 2 days later on Sunday, today,  and was advised that the system still had not been updated â perhaps because it was a weekend â I can't see why this is the case.  I asked about my chat and was advised that these are kept for existing customers but not for others â again I can't see why.  This advisor was based in the UK and was extremely helpful â she has noted that, as soon as my account details are available, she will contact me and discuss what offers are available and, if possible, try to include my Player TV at no extra cost. I was with Virgin for 7 years and, often I had to negotiate around a price increase, at renewal time.  In the end, this was too much and I moved to BT.  I had very few problems over this period and any time I contacted them, all my calls went to UK advisors and I don't remember any long delays .  The current customer service at Virgin is abysmal â the delays are ridiculous and the quality of advice was dreadful.  I don't know whether Virgin's customer base has greatly extended and they have failed to increase the customer staff or whether they have reduced the levels of customer staff, to cut costs, or whether the amount of complaints and enquiries has reached unexpected peaks but someone, somewhere should be aware of the adverse impact the current customer service is having on Virgin's reputation.",2.0

For the last 3 years, despite paying for the 100mbs package, I have had ongoing issues with speed, reliability and most notably, wireless signal. Despite MANY calls to their tech teams and eventually a replacement router, the service if anything has continued to deteriorate. One customer service agent admitted that Virgin Media have oversold their product in certain areas and do not have the capacity to provide the broadband speeds as advertised, or it seems, the reliability. Be vary wary of their advertised speeds - I have been unable to consistently achieve much over 20mbs at best via my wireless router for almost three years, despite having a 100mbs package.",1.0

Complain about the speed of my premium package kept fluctuating badly they said they couldn't do anything about it if the device was not connected via ethernet cable. I asked them to help me out they said yes but they would be a Â£99 callout charge for moving the router upstairs from downstairs. I waited for a week and one of their ""engineers"" came he literally stapled a cable to the barrister of the staircase and threw a large amount of cable wire upstairs, leaving it lying on the top of the stairs saying he could not do anymore. I had to spend the rest of my day sorting the wiring out neatly. Do not recommend this company, the customer database is big enough they don't care about new customers.",1.0

The point to this is i have now moved and contacted them about my move & id like to keep my service at my new place thats out of town. BUT? got told they dont supply cable to that AREA. little gutted as always had a great service from them. yes i was happy till i get told they put me on another 12 Month contract ( Remember i stated at the beginning i am moving within the next couple of months ) NOT Happy i stated listen to the recorded message & i stated i am moving so that member of STAFF should of said due to you moving i would advice not to change your package untill you move or it will put you on another 12 month contract & im sure all would agree here with me as i also deal with customers. also she should had stated what the address to your new place so we can check we have cable in that area. yet again another customer service point that should be asked but was not ( they can also listen back to the recording ) so with me now one unhappy customer being told i have 8 months to pay for and me stating all ive said above to listen back & also to hold that recording on file for me to take matters to court if need be, her reply was thats fine you take us to court as you will lose as we are a big company and will all cases and you will end up paying court cost... Then at that point i was more than pissed off with that kinda customer service & i stated if she worked for me you would be sacked on the spot for that kinda attitude....

They stil sent me payments like Â£104 once again so I had cancelled my direct debit with them! Now they are asking for the box and hub back which I find really stingy as I had Been with sky before and sky have never asked anything like that. We are sending our rubbish boxes back which were a waste of time and money and they will basically use these boxes for other customers which means I had been sent a second handed one too. Wow virgin.

Virgin have a phone divert package - although it took endless calls and research on line to find this out - however, you can only operate it by physically standing in front of your landline and punching in the divert codes. All other telephony companies I have used in the past offered a package with a remote call divert on-off option. But NOT Virgin. Not only that, but their call divert fee is higher! I have to text a housemate every time and get them to do it.

I had to speak to one of their technicians on the street to get the real story.  The phone team is a joke.  I am leaving and going to Sky right away (not that I trust any of them really).

We waited for the technician to sort the problem and after all day waiting were told that he would only come today (tuesday), when he came told us that was not possible to install virgin here. Went to the shop and no one actually tried anything to help us. We still don't know why we can't have this because the only thing that the manager did was cancel our service without even asking us if we would like to have the problem sorted. We were once again almost 2 hours in the store looking to the manager on the phone (this hadn't told us what he was doing) and after all this he told us the problem was sorted and everything was cancelled. Awfull service and organisation. The manager didn't have any knowledge about the engineer coming to our place and there is no one we can actually talk with about a problem.

When I eventually got through to customer services on Sunday I was told there was a problem in my area and it will be sorted  at 9.25pm which I thought was a very precise but odd time. It still wasn't sorted at 5am Monday morning. I begrudge paying Â£80 a month for a service I can't use. Am shopping around for another provider but Virgin are the only ones who do fibre optic broadband in my area. Old router we had before the so called upgrade was much more reliable and faster.

1970,"I moved to Virgin because of the fibre broadband. I was not interested in the phone, but they convinced me that just paying 2Â£ extra getting a 29Â£ package I would get phone and tv. Did that and then they said it would be easier if i gave them my current phone number, as it would be easier to move my current phone and then they would automatically with my current provider in cancelling our services. I did that. They installed the broadband but they said they could not install the phone, but they would contact me in a couple of days. I was never contacted, so I called and they said that sorry but still they could not give me an appointment for the phone. Afterwards, my first bill came, it was 135 Â£. I called virgin and they said not to worry that because the system sees that I do not have phone installed, it is not calculating properly my bill and that they would put the extra on my next bill. The next month, again my bill was very high, called virgin and said that they had a capacity issue and cannot install the phone. I realized then that also my previous provider were still billing us. I told them that why did not they cancel my services and they said that because they could not install the phone they did not cancel. After talking to manager, instead of fixing the problem the solution they gave me is to move to a more expensive package without phone of 45Â£, to cancel or to go to deadlock. They told me if i accepted the new package  or cancelling i was not allowed to make any further complaints. They did not want to reimburse my activation fees, or the fact that i was paying for phone but never got the service. In addition, that i was being billed from another provider. The manager was so rude and kept on saying that all this is in my contract. When i asked her to tell me where in my contract does it state this, she said she said she will come back to me. She called me again, and said it was not in the contract but they could not honour it and these are the solutions they are providing me.

Had one guy on yet another long and boring call to virgin if I rebooted via WiFi I would not have a problem again. When I tried this it said I didn't recognise my WiFi address. Another person said she would escalate it as she could see I had a problem and she promised someone would back. And can you guess??? No one did. I rang to complain no one had rung and still no one did. After more dull boring calls to virgin I threatened to leave as I was paying for a crap service. Was told I would have to pay them Â£198.00 to leave. I managed to get the snowflake I spoke to get an engineer out and I wasn't paying for one. Snowflake got upset I swore when speaking to him well if he carries on working with virgin he needs to get used to it people are angry with a crap service.,1.0

2024,I feel so let down by virgin media today. I am a property manager and requested a enginneer visit today as a managed house has no broadband working. I was given a time slot of 8-12pm today and requested a call 30 mins before as we do not Live at this address. I got a call when the enginneer was there and not 30 mins before so he couldnât wait for me.  He told me to call into virgin and explain. The call handler was very unhelpful and wouldnât confirm another enginneer for today. When I asked to escalate the issue he wouldnât transfer me to a manager or someone that would be able to help me. I persisted so he raised his voice to me.  I asked to be transfers to customer retention and he hung up my call after a total call duration of 25 minutes. Virgin I am sorely disappointed that my tenants are going to be left now with no broadband from your poor service. Please help me here get the right service before we take our 25 plus packages elsewhere.  Just useless,1.0

2029,"Words can't possibly describe how bad the customer service of Virgin Media is. Being a customer of 7 years I have been very very unhappy with Virgin lately when I had to deal with customer service. MOBILE contract and data: I have recently finished paying up my phone so decided to get a new one. Not only they have sent it through Yodel who didn't deliver it even though we were home all the time, they sent it back, they canceled the new contract AS WELL AS MY OLD CONTRACT. I had to call them around 6 times that week and spent 30-40 minutes approximately on the phone with a new staff every time. In the end, they concluded there was a system error and they will call me back in a few days. They never did (3 different members of staff said they'd call me back).  My phone was cut off for about a week. In the end, they gave me some top up but in reality, it meant I still had no minutes to call. I decided not to go for the new phone but still wanted some sort of contract since they canceled my old one and had no connection with the world.  I was exhausted by all this and my boyfriend ended up calling them one last time. I got a new one at the end but they never apologized or investigated or offered a new solution. I wish I could go with another provider but seemed complicated with keeping my number so unfortunately, I had to go with Virgin again. On the other way, they started harassing me from BROADBAND side: Around the same time as the thing with my phone happened, I also realized I suddenly started paying twice as much for broadband. I realized that the first year was a promotion. I do feel it wasn't really clearly stated at the beginning but it is equally my fault not to properly read the terms.  However, we instantly called Virgin and changed to a more convenient deal.  Nevertheless, since then they haven't stopped harassing me. Every single day they call me, first they ask for 'Mr. Wilson' (wrong name) and then they want to continue asking why I canceled and try to offer a new deal. Every day Every day, I tell them that a new contract is starting from 17th, I ask them to take me off the list and make it clear that they had called 6 times already. Words cannot describe how fed up I am with them. Their only plus is the cost of having to deal with organizing new providers which I've no time for. Very reluctantly, I am continuing to pay this company who I would happily rate minus 1000 stars for customer service.",1.0

2035,"I ordered fiber broadband 100MBs 13 days ago and had quite a few headaches to date (still no internet tough). Here is the list?- had a great call service provided, when I specifically asked about required landlord set up approval. I was told not to worry about it. Great, right? I wish: Few days later, wife called me at work telling me some Virgin engineer just started drilling holes around the external part of the property without even ringing the bell to warn anyone. Landlord, of course, had gone crazy about his property damaged. Engineer was stopped by Landlord and left holes unfixed.- After several call center long calls and lots of unreasonable re-schedule options, I finally managed to schedule visit of specialized team to explain the sort of work that would be required - agreed with landlord and Virgin staff on a property setup procedure and confirmed visit for a full job (both external and internal), 4 days lates (same original set up date). Specialized team assured me no new external visit would be required as they would do all work under one single visit. Did not confirm time though.- At the supposed visit day, I had both the landlord and wife waiting since 8am and no one came or called ahead until 6pm. I did call around 1pm and had the visit schedule confirmed to same day by Virgin representative. Only at 6pm they returned a call to let me know they would not be able to install it due to lack of landlord authorization (i know! crazy, huh). After I updated the Virgin representative, he tried to reach the field team, who was unresponsive due to 6.05pm time after work-hours. So, I would not have the installation done, would lose my previous provider the following day and no solution presented from Virgin such as next day installation priority. The best I was offered was many `so sorry` and `cannot set a new date` empty replies.- So Virgin left me with no estimated date of setup, annoyed landlord, no broadband left from my previous provider. Service sounds great on paper and sales team call but awful setup consumer experience.",2.0

2048,"Had Virgin Broadband for just under a year and have lost count how many times I lose service. Usually it's an area fault and they can take anywhere between an hour and most of the day to fix it, meaning there must be hundreds, if not thousands of people in my area who suffer the same problem. A couple of days ago the same thing happened although, according to Virgin, it was just me and they did tests from their end and couldn't find anything wrong. They said an engineer would have to come to me and the earliest they could get one to me was in three days time! I work from home and am heavily reliant on the internet. Three days could have cost me my business. Fortunately, it started working again on it's own, although that perhaps makes it more worrying as if Virgin didn't know what the problem was and didn't fix it, it's something that could easily happen again. Unfortunately, Virgin are the only company that provides a broadband service to my building, so I don't have the option of going elsewhere. I had EE for what must have been at least 7 or 8 years, before I moved here and I never had a loss of service in that time. Their ""customer service"" also leaves a lot to be desired. I must have been passed around 6 or 7 departments while trying to get it sorted, left hanging on for several minutes, several times and the attitude of most of the people I spoke to was unhelpful to say the least. I get why people would have Virgin if, like me, they have no choice but if there is any other option - get it!!!",1.0

I told them that I did not want to go into a 2nd year contract with them if they were forcing me to have additional services I did not require or request and at that steep pricing. I was told pat Â£35 to the end of contract and that be it. I paid the Â£35 and then I was billed again Â£163 by a company called BPO. I then called Virgin media again to only be on a conversation with a confused mam telling me that he did not know who told me I owed  Â£35 ad I was in a roll over contact and that he was telling me the truth. ...so what your saying is that last Virgin media rep was telling me a lie. I asked him to pull my notes up in regards to conversations I have had previously he told me there was none but I thought calls were recorded funny that when you disputing something your call is not recorded all the time.  I was told I owe this and it needs paying but it is not fair as I never requested these additional services and my contract has ended plus I was I must now put in writing if I wish to close my account .

It might be a coincidence, but after 6 years of mobile service without this type of issue, the timing of this anomily seems rather inconvenient and appears to be a petty tactic... especially for a company like vm to be inflicting upon it's customer base.  I have three mobile contracts with them and i am looking to move all the services as far away from vm as possible. I dont wish to trade with a company that potentially believes that it is acceptable to behave in such a vindictive manner. I would rather pay more to a competitor.

2200,"AVOID AVOID AVOID PlEASE READ THIS BEFORE CHOOSING TO GO WITH VIRGIN THEY ARE USELESS AND BREAK THEIR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS BUT EXPECT YOU TO ABIDE BY THEM EVEN WITHOUT SEEING THEM This is my experience with them I called virgin in January 2017 to have services installed into my property an instalment date for beginning of February was arranged and I was told by the sales team and in txt messages that before they come in they have to do a site check to make sure all cables are in place but they do not need access to my house (why they asked in a txt message if I would like to be in for this baffles me if they didn't need indoor access, after several call to virgin and then to the actual telecommunications company (kellys)I was told that the cables are in place and ready to install at my property. Fast forward to my instalment date of 2/2/2017 an engineer arrive to install my equipment only to find that the cable had were not ready and him and another colleague that he called came round and they themselves run the cables (the poor man was at my property for nearly three hours. Once all the cables had been laid the installation went ahead the engineer was very polite and helpful although did seem a little perplexed that he had to do the job of someone else. After no more than two weeks I was searching through the channels and I noticed that certain freeview channels were not available to watch as they were not included in my package, after calling virgin I got told this if you want those channels you have to upgrade at a cost of an extra Â£10 per month when I asked why I cannot have freeview channels and the clue is in the word freeview which means they are free to view the response I got was yes but we would be charging you for the extra channels that wasn't free to view i.e documentaries I did ask to just have the freeview channels to which I got told this wouldn't be happening, during this conversation I asked for my account number, my telephone number and a copy of their terms and conditions, I got told we cant give you those details over the phone due to data protection but they would send them out in the post. A few days on I noticed that my TiVo box seemed to be buffering for quite a while when trying to watch recordings I called virgin to see if there was a problem and after several arguments with them saying that they cant access my account without either my account or telephone number I explained well if you  give me these things I would be able to tell you them and again I asked for them and their terms and conditions, I finally had to tell them to access my account using my postcode to which they did, after a few checks I was told there is a national problem and this is the reason the boxes aren't working I had to explain again that my box was working just buffering to which they replied ah well then you are not part of the national problem and they hung up on me, so I had to call back by this point I am now very frustrated and expressed that this in unacceptable (albeit I was polite and will opening admit I swore and got told we do not have to deal with such language to which I replied its not against you personally but about the company you choose to work for, they finally agreed to send an engineer, in two weeks times to which I said ok can you pls send him with a new TiVo box as this one is clearly dodge. I waited in all day at a loss off Â£300 for no one to turn up when I called to find out what the hell is happening (again I was angry)I got told the screen said I said dnt bother turning up when I in fact i said there would be no point turning up if he isn't bringing a TiVo box with him, they then tried to arrange another appointment to which I asked them to agree that if they dnt turn up again for a second time the would reimburse me the loss of Â£300 to which they refused saying our terms and conditions state we have 3 attempts to turn up again I reiterated that I still haven't got them or account and telephone number, so almost a year later im still using and paying for a DODGY TiVo box. In June I noticed that a certain prog was only recording for an hour as per their listings but the program was actually on for an hour and fifteen min to which I was told well we need 48 hours to update their systems and I could always watch it on catch up. A few months on I noticed that my internet kept dropping out or simply not working again I called and had the usual C**p from them about needing account number (by this point I was losing the will to live) the lady done a check on my internet line and told the problem should now be fixed to which I replied well its not cos its still doing the same again I got told an engineer had to come out to which I refused on the basis they dnt turn up  So now I am paying for a DODGY TiVo box and internet that chooses when and if it wants to work I received an email from virgin in September saying this is your pre contract just sign and send back and we can start your services in feb, I have in fact been paying since feb as they were installed. At the beginning of this year 5/1/18 my series link didn't record one of my programs when I checked to see if it was on I noticed that the listings said the said prog had been first aired the Friday before (the prog was Hollyoaks and they never repeat) I didn't call virgin as I accept that sometimes these things happen or so I thought, on 11th Jan I notice that again my box wasn't recording a prog on itv (loose women) I checked the listings to see that the program before (this morning) was on from 10:30 to 13:30 as this program is live I thought there must be some sort of breaking news so I turned to itv so see what had happended and low and behold their were four women sitting behind a desk with a sign behind them stating loose women I checked my sky box (which I had installed back in june due to their incompetence of me missing the end of my programs)and also checked my freeview tv listings and asked my niece who lives in a completely different property to check her now tv box and all three were showing loose women was showing. I called virgin and again went the same rubbish about account number ect to be told by a very helpful person (in Scotland) that her box didn't record the same prog on Monday either so it was at this point we worked out the prob couldn't be my box, after being put through to faults I was told we will do a check on your box and refer this to the network department and they would contact me within four days I asked what happens if this happens again to which I was told and I quote ""we promise this wouldn't happen again"" I expressed that this had happened back in june so what was the protocol to which he replied ""i dnt know"" so I told him go ask your manager and call me back. Fast forward four and half hours no call back so I called back only to be told that prob takes four hours not four days to solve and that they will speak to second line, he came back and said I would need an engineer to come out to which I replied why when one of your co-workers had the same prob I got told in rather a rude manor well you didn't tell me that before I went through to 2nd line I replied this is should be on your screen as I had expressed this to the last person I spoke to - SURPRISE SURPRISE they didn't put this info on the computer. After several phone calls to second line myself we established that indeed it was not my box but there listings but they couldn't do anything about past recordings but do I know any future ones that are incorrect, surely this is not my job to check but I did and I informed them.  I then finally put my complaint into Tom Mockridge (CEO) by email and after again several calls back and forth I received a letter from them stating that unless I do not have service for a whole twenty four hours then I wouldn't be credited at this was their terms and conditions (which I still have not received) but have received my account and telephone number now in this letter dated 18th January 2018, they also stated they do not advertise they are a fault free services as you can imagine my response was not nice but I simply worded it I have never advertised that I am a millionaire but would they accept I can only pay three weeks out of the four I THNIK NOT At the time of writing this review virgin have until close of business today to solve this prob and upon checking the two progs which I informed them were incorrect listing last week are still saying the same..... I dnt hold much hope that they will be updated by 10pm this evening so another (and this time I wont be as polite) email will be send this evenings and if they dnt apply credit to account I will simply apply my own by not paying my next months bill",1.0

2202,"Virgin is an absolute joke. We have had ongoing problems since the day we agreed to have virgin. Firstly they sent us a self instal kit. Despite being told several times that we do not have any cables. I know this for a 100% fact as when i did my front garden up 3 years ago, i removed the bits of the remaining cable & told virgin this when i called to order their service. They did not listen. We rang them several times speaking to several different so called managers. Eventually after 2 MONTHS. They sent a crew out to instal our service. When they arrived & looked they said "" we cant instal anything as you do not have any cables"". These engineers rang virin & told them. They still did not listen & sent the same crew back later the same day. 2 days later another crew was working opposite my house. They kindly looked at the connection points & told us what we have been telling them for 2 months. No cables!!! They also said that it needs rewiring back to the main junction box. We relayed this back to virgin who told us it would be another 4 weeks before anyone could sort this. In the meantime they sent us 2 bills. We told them they could do the same with their bill as a duck does with its bill. ( stick it up its @#$%). I am not paying for a service i havent even had. So they said they would deduct it from the referal fee which would bring the bill down. Eventually after around 3 months waiting, our service was up & running. I say running but it was more of a stroll. Within the first week the so called 200mbps internet speed crashed while halfway through watching the new beauty & the beast on netflix. The system was not overloaded as the only wifi device using the internet was our tv. We rang virgin & had to speak to several managers about this. Eventually they agreed it was their fault & they would credit our account. They tried fobbing us off with a Â£10 credit but we did not accept that. Needless to say this was not the end of the issues. Since april 2017 we have had no end of issues with virgin. When you ring them the system recognises you are on a mobile phone, then preceeds to tell you that there is a problem in your postcode area & they are working on it & it will be fixed in the next few days. This has been going on for around 6 months. We have NEVER seen an engineer doing ANY work in the area since we had virgin installed. The final straw came when the sent us a bill for just over Â£160. When we rang to queery this they said it was for 2 months bills. Now i am no carol vorderman but i can count. We signed up for 200mbps full house service at Â£55 pcm. Now in my head & even on my calculator 2 x Â£55 = Â£110.  I even took my shoes & socks off to make doubley sure. To be fair my count was 1 out as i had a bunion on my big toe. We told virgin that we will not pay anything until the service is up & running correctly. They said we need to talk to technical services but before they can put us through we have to pay the bill.!!!!! So guess what??? Yep back to the duck. I would not reccomend virgin to my worst enemy. Stick to sky. It cost more but the service is much better.",2.0

2206,"I signed up for a 3 month rolling contract for virgin broadband in June this year. I paid a start up fee to enter this contract so to avoid cancellation fee's, as I knew I was only to be int the property for 6 months.  The contract was wrongly processed as a 12 month contract, so when I tried to cancel my policy 6 months later, I was asked to pay a Â£90 leaving fee.  I rang multiple times and was passed around so many departments that I must have spoken to around 30 people over all about this problem - none of them willing to help, or even to listen to me for more than 3 minutes, in an attempt to avoid responsibility.  I then provided written evidence that I signed up for a 3 month contract and still they would not process my request. The man at the store I bought from told me that things could only be resolved over the phone. I also proved that I paid the signing up fee, but they dismissed it as a unknown expense.  Finally I went into a different store and sat with a member of their team who was also sent around the different departments.  When he stuck up for me, the caller at the other end asked to take his colleague number, to file a complaint against him (the only person actually helping!!) He continued to argue my case and almost an hour later, they said they would process the cancellation without a fee - over a month after I first tried to do so myself.  I was provided with the appropriate information to return my equipment and a returns package came in the post. I returned it on the agreed termination date and thought all was sorted... It was not.   After the equipment was returned I was still being charged. When queried they said I needed to pay for another 2 months, plus late charges. This was ridiculous and bared no reason, but losing my will to fight I agree'd to pay the 2 months charge with the late charges removed.  When signing in to pay these 2 months, the bill still displayed the higher amount, past the time he said it would be updated. I rang, once again, dreading the same palaver I had endured before.  I rang stating ""I rang earlier this month to dispute a bill for Â£60.46, the virgin media representative told me he had reduced this to Â£42 and that the new bill would come through by the 15th. I've gone onto my account today (17th) and it STILL hasn't updated. I was wondering if you could correct this for me, so that I can avoid any more late charges"". To my dismay, he responded ""Actually your current bill stands at Â£120 as it also includes a cancelation fee"". I explained the situation and once again was passed around 4 different departments (ending at the same one I started with). This time I was ready to call consumer rights and explained that I would not be passed on again.  To my luck, a woman called Joanna finally talked to the manager of customer services who removed the additional charges and got my bill back down to Â£41. It still wasn't the Â£26 I should have paid for a final month subscription (theres a 1 month notice period), but i took it!  I was so happy to be disassociated from this horrible horrible company. They have THE WORST customer service I have EVER experienced.  They scam you from every direction and it seems the only use of their ""helpline"" is to tire you out, until you can't fight no more.  2 months after I first tried to cancel, I am FINALLY free (I hope!).

The customer service was rubbish and the technician wasnât much help so Iâm left paying for a WiFi until I can get a hold of virgin and find out what is going on.

2237,Bought full Broadband TV package because former BT was too slow and cost escalating. TV package (basic) is good although we have notice transmission breaks of a few seconds on occasions. Broadband - initial problems with speed because router was not in same room as PC (steel ceiling joist caused 'Faraday Cage' affect) - solved by elec ring main 'Power line' extension. Rating reflects initial speed. Email page is not as user friendly as previous BT,2.0
2238,"First things first, the speed of the broadband is very fast, I cannot fault it there at all. We get around 80-100 mbps which is what we pay for. However, the internet will drop on average 4-5 times a DAY. The broadband hub then resets itself which can take up to 40 minutes to turn back on. We have had endless talks with Virgin, including having an engineer come out and being sent a new hub... these did nothing.The customer service team run you in circles and tell you to do the same thing over and over. A big negative for me is that I suffer with a disability which means I am often unable to talk on the phone. When I cannot they offer an online chat service, that is ALWAYS busy. I got to use it about three times in the 10 months of internet problems (the current full length of my contract). When I rang last I explained my disability issue again at the end of the call and asked for an email address... there isn't one. So I asked for a physical address to send a complaint... there isn't one? You can talk to the community on a message board, however this is a slow and clunky way of doing it and useless if your internet isn't working. They have an online video chat for people who use sign language. Great, but I don't and again you have to use the internet! A simple email address to go back and forth to from a library or from your mobile data would be so much easier. Overall an unreliable service with poor communication with anything other than a phone (which is always automated your first call until you'r asked to call back). Would not recommend at all.",3.0

We moved house on 25th of November and moved with talktalk as we were still in contract. From day one we had no internet. After frustrating chats online and numerous phone calls out we finally got an engineer to come out who spent 2 hours at our house to tell us that there is nothing wrong with the line it's defiantly on talktalk side (we previously had 2 engineers cancel on us when we stayed at home). Again after numerous phone calls they just kept saying you will be updated in 72 hours so I decided to bite the bullet and cancel altogether and went with BT as a new customer as it had some good opening offers. Our live date should of been on the 20th of December but guess what? Orange light and when I phoned BT they said would have send an engineer out even though the last time they said it's all talk talk side. I had enough at this point big time right before Christmas! I decided to call virgin and not only did I realise we could get it at our new property the customer service was fantastic! They talked me through everything and managed to get an engineer come out to set it all up for us 2 days later! Not the standard 10 days you normally have to wait! The engineer come out and was here for 2 hours and told us there was some bad news.. the line is to worn and he can't find a signal so he won't be able to do the job (at this point I couldn't believe our luck) he said he would phone his manager and we would go from there.. 30 mins later get a knock at the door two lads are here apologising and put in a brand new line for us and then the engineer come back out and see it all up for us!

Regrettably it seems Virgins different departments, contractors etc donât talk to each other so they canât arrange to carry out the work in the correct order.The call centre staff are polite but some have a poor command of English plus they donât appear to understand what work is required.Fortunately I currently have a very slow Openreach connection so I am not quite isolated.

Out of principle I swtiched to BT. BT only offer 57 Mbps against 70 from virgin so was unsure if it would be as good but virgin only ever achieved 30 Mbps over the wifi at the tablet.

2257,"I have never written a review before so I am sorry I have taken this long. I was with Virgin Broadband and TV for over 10 years up to 2016, the last 6 years I had only landline and broadband with them. They went from providing a good customer service (during the blue yonder period) to a poor service of deliberate lies and excuses. I think more problems occurred when the company changed hands: Hiking up my bills within 4 months for 3 years when I had been promised and agreed a certain fixed price.  Not being able to access my email despite typing the correct password. Sometimes waiting 5 mins to get into my email. Being passed from one department to the other.   My bills were always paid on-time by Direct Debit. I didn't mind there being a problem just as long as it wasn't frequent and that any problem would be solved quickly (and I mean immediately or within two days).   I left Virgin because of the fluctuating prices and their dishonesty. Yet when I gave them notice that I was leaving, I had a numerous calls from a separate operation centre related to Virgin. They were rude with either a sarcastic tone, bullying tone and sometimes hung up on me when told them that I had already given notice to leave and I would not return. They were ringing everyday and I had to make a complaint to Virgin. Thankfully I spoke to someone who was mature and sensible. I had my credit sent within days, cut off was smooth. Now reading the reviews of so many broadband providers I can agree that a company is only as good as its workers. I am now regrettably, with Post Office Broadband and the only winners in this are Openreach the engineers they 'have to use'. Their customer service is diabolical - the internet when a second   person is using it in the home - even more so. (Avoid Post Office Broadband. If you are desperate use the library or a friend/relative because believe me it is not worth 18 months of your life.  After reading countless reviews and listening to comments, including the younger members of my household the Post Office broadband is not worth the bother. In conclusion: WE should dictate our terms.

And set yet another date in 2 weeks time, so 1 month from the day they(themselves) damaged the cable. Remember im without internet for 2 weeks already and we  knew at first day that this has to be done. So i called Virgin and questioned that, they apologised and passed me to the tech team, who said dont worry we are going to send another tech guy tomorrow and he will fix it temporarily until we fix it properly 2 weeks later.The guy came next day and what do you think he said? yet again the same words that the cable is damaged and new one has to be put in, i gave up calling after that, as i could see there is no point so i was waiting another 2 weeks, 1 month in total for them to come and fix it. do you think there is a happy ending? well you are optimistic.the evening before Virgin were to come to fix it ( 1 month after the fault was reported) i called their customer service just to confirm that everything is going ahead and someone is finally coming, and to check the time frame when.The customer services dropped the line 2 times, then when i finally got through, they couldnt answer, so passed me to tech team? they couldnt answer or confirm anything as well, so i was passed to construction department, and the answer i got: oh we actually are not coming tomorrow, someone should have called you( nobody did) as we cant do it, we have to do construction works and it can take up to 6-8 weeks. At that point i was truly shocked as  i couldnt believe its all happening. So i asked to cancel my account, i must admit this is the only efficient and quick thing i got from Virgin, i was told that my services are disconnected within probably 2 minutes, no questions asked.  To summarise, Avoid at all costs, appalling absolutely shocking service all the way through, thats me being their customer for a few years.",2.0

He then called me a liar and thought he could switch it off twice before the date it was due to end despite the fact I had paid for it. He then went on to say they wanted to equipment back and were sending bags out despite the fact customers pay for the equipment themselves and there isn't any claws stating they have to have it back, or that there would be any charges in the contracted agreement. I later discovered through talking to open reach engineers this is a tactic that they use often, to scare subscribers into staying or keeping their old equipment long enough that it isn't worth anything.  My advice to all, despite deals they may offer you avoid virgin media as if it was the plague. Not only is their service disgusting but their broadband is awful with download speeds dropping to 0.1 MB at times (and yes I did complain and yes I tried everything to improve it).

We cancelled the account, one week later, my husband received a call with an offer and a date of installation, and again no one showed up.

2298,"Be very careful with your bill. They just hit me with a price increase not priorly informed of. I have just a broadband package which states a set price for 12 months with an installation fee. There was a general price increase on November 1st which I did not receive confirmation of nor is it in my contract that my introductory plan was subject to any increase. Low and behold, my latest bill goes up by Â£2.99 a month. Their online chat service is never available, there is no availability of the previous contact with customers online nor could I find any such confirmation of an increase. I called Virgin media today - the lady talked over me, told me a confirmation had been sent but she could not provide that email confirmation to me and then told me to stop being rude. I have lost my voice, so was unable to raise my voice in any way; I was explaining my situation when she just cut me off saying 'I'm going to just put through to THE TEAM'. I was already on hold by the time I got through to what was actually the retention team. I spoke to Sarah there, who rectified the problem and gave me a credit of the Â£2.99 per month until my contract expires; so all worked out in the end - I assume a glitch in the system that means even us 'new favoured' customers get stung and they cash in on those who don't notice or check that they shouldn't get an increase. With this in mind, what they're doing here is illegal. A notice must be given of any increase and it must be stated in the T&Cs that price increases are allowed on introductory offers, neither of which happened here. Had I have not checked my bill regularly and noticed this discrepancy, contacted them myself and specified my knowledge of the law, I would have just been charged more - who knows how much more I would have been charged going forward. This company has the monopoly in my area, I was with a previous provider when I moved here and couldn't get more than 1MB download speed so I do not have a choice but to go with VM. This makes it very difficult to be a consumer and action my right to pay to be with a fair and trusted company.  If you have a problem with your bill, don't call the normal number, they won't help you.

Even your âEnglish staff agree, if by coincidence I get through to them and not your lpoor commmision chasing badly managed lieing Indian call center . Itâs so bad, I wish I could disclose my email. Please donât be tempted by their sleazy tactics. They are the worst con in the Uk, and offcom or whoever needs to take action.

This has been consistently happening since the beginning of the year, they claimed to reimburse but it only showed up on one of my bills. Around March we kept complaining and they told us they were going to have signalling issues most weekends and evenings till August 2nd. We waited and still there was issues. They delayed us again until September 13th and that was when it started to work again up until recently where there has been major problems resulting in us having no tv or wifi. Virgin are currently in the news for having major signalling issues We have received poor customer support and service, considering the cost against other networks.  My advice to you all, it is not all bad as when the WiFi works itâs great but itâs a high cost for a terrible service and customer care.

2367,"I'm going to write an HONEST review as it seems most reviews are from people who come online while they are upset so I wanted to write one from a neutral perspective to help people decide. Overall Virgin Media is pretty good though it does come with a few problems and they have recently told me that when it comes to reimbursement from downtime they do it specifically by the day, in other words they no longer give you anything back as a gesture which I think is bad for a company that makes millions off every day people, one of the things for me that keeps me with a company is how they treat you and appreciate you as a customer (O2 lead by example on this!!) so they have become pretty greedy with money really and I think this should be changed. About the speeds, well generally I get good solid speeds of around 70 - 75 MB on the download and this is usually good, even on Wi-Fi too on my phone I get this and the signal seems pretty strong considering the router is upstairs and the room downstairs connects fine with the blu ray player which is opposite side of the house downstairs, we get around 2 - 3 bars on the signal strength and Netflix words fine BUT (and this is a big but) their consistency isn't the greatest and I have had a few outages recently and quite a lot of line drops, some of these line drops are so small you don't notice but they are there and stability isn't really their strongest thing (I'm not sure if any other company has this but Virgin definitely don't), watching Sky Go can often get the odd buffer due to this and I do think this is something Virgin need to get sorted considering they're not the cheapest of the bunch, which brings me to that point, the cost. Virgin Media are a little over priced, in fact VERY over priced really because although the packages and services sound good (and they are when they're running consistently) they're not very solid, they're very tight now due to a new 'policy' recently of only able to credit any downtime you have by the hour due to the computers and how they log reimbursements, so basically if you're a day without internet you're probably going to get a couple of quid, if that, which is pretty bad considering how other companies give you good gestures of good will after loss of service etc... so they're starting to become a bit greedy really and that's VERY off putting. They need to reduce their prices a LOT if they really want to compete and be the best out there because when you're paying so much for a broadband that's not really all that stable most of the time, it's pretty bad and even so they are still over priced. Generally the experience is good but it's not good to validate the prices they charge by any means, other than you do get a good speed (maybe different area's have different experiences). I guarantee that less is more for them and they would have a TON of extra customers had they have had lower prices but I don't think they would do that because they seem to be getting a little more money greedy than anything else really from what they told me yesterday about their new reimbursement policy, I just thought that was terrible.  Customer services depends who you get, I called a guy recently and explained about how my internet had been dropping and cutting out a lot lately, he pretty much said to me that there was no record of it (basically calling me a liar) yet trust me it had been dropping out, he went on to say how they don't reimburse Wi-Fi loss (understandable) but I explained that it wasn't just Wi-Fi because ALL the connections went down, including my PC which is WIRED, he pretty much denied it and it was a complete wasted phone call, however a guy I spoke to later when it happened again was much more helpful, but he told me about the new policy about reimbursement where they have brought in a system where they can only give the exact downtime they see, no little gestures or anything, nothing and as mentioned above, I think that's pretty bad as it feels you're not really valued as a customer and they only give you back what they HAVE to by law basically, which is what I mean about how they treat you as a customer. Getting through to them isn't the hardest but it is a bit of a pain going through the system, this could be much easier (specially with the password crap on the automated system) and I've always had advisers in the UK too thankfully (nothing against the people abroad but they don't understand most of the time and we need this of course for these kind of things) so it's pretty touch and go really but all round the customer services haven't been too bad really.  To be fair, I don't think the UK have a very good outstanding broadband provider so there's no competition for these companies to give best prices and services as Virgin have the speeds and strength but as mentioned above, so they don't need to be any better to us yet other companies might have a bit better service but don't have the speeds we often need for things such as Sky Go, Netflix etc.. and Wi-Fi strength in the home. Soon as a good broadband provider offers this at an affordable price for everyone, they are going to be soaring above the rest and all these companies such as Virgin will just fall and that's what they need. It seems a shame that the UK hasn't got a solid leading internet provider like we do with the phone services, such as O2 for example who are brilliant for 99% of people when it comes to everything and have been for many years. Internet providers need to take note and someone out there needs to spice up the competition for these people. I hope this has helped :-)",2.0

Virgin is known to not to have content for the TV and that's why their TV packages costs the most. However, I thought their fibre broadband must be good and reliable. Unfortunately, it is worst of the three core services they provide. For us, broadband going down is a weekly affair very much like their outsourced customer support services. And for now it is down from last 4 days and the earliest an engineer can visit to look at the issue is one week wait. There is no guarantee it will be fixed. It's only the visit to look at the issue. Why Virgin sign up so many customers if they can not support and make customer wait for weeks to fix? Broadband is a basic service and outsourced customer support of Virgin outside UK thinks this is a premium service which should be used only on a need basis. Calling Virgin customer support is such a useless experience and waste of time because team is unskilled and have no understanding or appreciation of the issues you are facing. They will make false promises and there is no one in the UK to talk to you. So when you are in trouble, it is like talking to a wall.  In summary, if you are looking for media services, remove Virgin from your list to even consider.

Rang them as the engineer left and was passed from department to department till finally spoke to preinstall dept. Told me there was no problems with being oversubscribed and would arrange for an engineer to come back out on the 4th of October to install phone. In the meantime the tv and broadband kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the service. Today the engineer came out only to repeat what the first engineer said on the 30th... instead of connecting phone, reconnected broadband and tv and commented on how badly virgin wee managing the install. 2 agreed installs later rang again to be passed from pillar to post only to be told they were going to charge Â£55 P/M due to not being able to install phone and this was the cost of the tv and broadband package I had been put on without the phone.

2422,"On 8 June this year I applied to virgin media for a bundle 100. After four weeks of wondering why there was no activity and making many phone calls I was informed that I needed documentation from the property owner approving my request. This was done and sent to virgin media in July.. I was informed that it would take several weeks to organise so my installation was booked for 22 August. On the appointed day I waited for the installer. He arrived late and refused to install the cable modem where I requested. I live in a two-storey stone building in the modem was installed in a diagonal corner of the base level. However when he set boxes up he informed me that one of the boxes was not working so he would have to replace it. He also installed a TiVo box which got an error message. He informed me that I should keep turning the TiVo box on and off and eventually it would work. At this point he left.Imagine my surprise when four days later I was told, on my fifth call, that the error message that I was receiving from the TiVo box meant that the box was broken and would have to be replaced. I was also informed at this stage that because the Wi-Fi box had been replaced I had no Internet because the MAC address could not be changed by people that I could talk to. However it had been referred to someone and it should be done within three days. This took me to Monday, 28 August.My new TiVo box arrived in the mail. I installed and however it did not work either. Several telephone calls later the IT support people informed me that there was some problem in the system and they would have to book a call to 5 September. That being the earliest call they had available.On 5 September I waited at home looking forward to having my Internet bundle working. At 7 PM I rang virgin to ask where the installer was. I was informed that the appointment had been cancelled by virgin because they'd been having system issues and they thought that my have fixed my problem. By now I was up to more than 20 hours of phone charges on a mobile call. And somewhat surprisingly virgin media staff were starting to object to my language and frustration.By now my virgin media farce had been running for three months and I still had no Internet bundle. After several more hours of attempted support on the phone I was informed that a visit by another install would be required to figure out what the problem was. However, it would be September 22 before they could have someone arrive.At this stage my partner and I decided that the farce had gone on long enough. We would cancel this attempt. However even that was not to be the simple exercise that we expected. Over an hour later we still had people trying to convince us that virgin media was either not incompetent or not malicious. However they finally took our word for it that we were irretrievably opposed to ever having anything to do with virgin media ever again. Interestingly the young lady would not give receive reference number or any other information that would allow us to refer back to the discussion we were having with her. However she did make the comment during this call that virgin media egregious behaviour over the previous three months should not be held against us, and that there should be no charge applied to our account. She even put us on hold for five minutes while she went away and confirmed this.Imagine my surprise when on 18 September I received a bill from virgin media to services rendered. So here is my review: if you are so filled with self-loathing that you wish to be messed around and treated as trash for several months virgin media may be a company you wish to be involved with. I personally will go out of my way to inform any person asking any questions of my opinions regarding broadband and media supply in the UK to avoid this group, and I personally will attempt to make sure that I never again have anything to do with this group. Oh and by the way I am taking the matter of the final bill to the ombudsman.",1.0

Apologetic, but went away again without making it at all clear what would happen next . Phoned customer services to make the point that, apart from establishing that said cable existed, the sales team had asked me absolutely no questions in relation to the practicalities of the installation. Thus they are unable to fulfil the contract that I have signed, due in my view, to prioritising sales over service. The customer service team informed me that they have booked another installation appointment for 9 days time (without checking first whether this was feasible for me or not). This has left a huge problem as, in good faith, we had cancelled our existing internet provider contract and consequently will be without internet for 5 or 6 days. This is disastrous as our work within the public examination system relies on accessing the internet at home.

2455,"Not Fit For Purpose ! Virgin media is without a doubt the worst ISP I have come across since the dial up days. They are in short breaching regulations daily with knowingly selling faulty services to customers which is ongoing at the moment. If your considering their service ask about the known fault affecting all static IP customers and ask when it will be resolved. The answer undoubtedly is they do not know which I have been quoted for over 40 days.  Here are the other items which are deceiving in their contracts and sales pitch. 1.	Its 24 working hours SLA not 24 hours even if you are a 24/7 company from the point of the faultâ¦. This is actually 3 days of potential complete service loss as quoted from helpdesk engineer on 13/09/2017 2.	They are presently selling business service at 300Mb when they are universally aware of an ongoing issue with providing static IPs resulting in a 90% degrade in service. They will be quite happy to offer you 50% off your bill if you raise this with htem for a 90% loss of service though. Clearly, they are as bad at mathematics as they are at providing an internet service.  3.	If you are fortunate enough to be online then in short you will be lucky to see 20% of the speed which they quote you on the sales pitch. With that in mind why not ask them when you call what guarantee of service speed they have. The answer to this is none so in effect you can be paying for 300 and getting 10 and wonât be able to get out of the contract.  4.	Their Ts and Cs avoid any liability beyond the cost of the package so indemnity and loss of earnings is not covered. They are in fact directly waived in the contract which any company worth its weight would not have to put in a contract in the first place. 4. If you are fortunate enough to get through to the helpdesk (be prepared for upwards of 25 mins on hold) you will be even more fortunate to not be disconnected when trying to raise a fault or complaint. I was disconnected for 2 solid hours each time I tried to reach complaints repartment to have my issue resolved.  In short, their service is shambolic, we have been hard down 3 times in the first month. Their staff are inept at dealing with even the most basic of issues and their contact is basically to tie you in as they are as per above openly aware they have massive network issues. Really this is actually beyond the requirement for the regulator, knowingly selling faulty goods or services is actually fraud in my opinion.",2.0

This achieved nothing. After this I cancelled the contract, or so I thought.  As I had upgraded the line, I was on a new 12 month contract!  I handed in my cooling off notice one day late (apparently, I am convinced I did it the day before).  Citing that I never actually recieved a speed increase, and THEY were in breach of contract, I declined to pay the Â£250 cancellation charge. I called 3 times and was promised call backs from managers.  Each time they did not do so.  The only thing they are EXCELLENT at is sending you bills.  After leaving the ball in their court to call me back for the third time, they didnt bother and instead sent me a summons which will probably be on my credit rating for the next 5 years. In the end I settled half the bill (still an insult) and wasted maybe 10+ hours on technical helplines before and after for a service I didn't receive.   IN SHORT - Avoid like the plague.

2464,Ive been with vigin media around a year and am in a 18 months contract. Our internet had been going off for some time over about six months but gradually got worse and became very unreliable especially when streaming. My partner had to keep unscrewing a lead from the back to reboot but it was a temporary fix. He had contacted virgin media through forums and over the phone and hadnt got anywhere. We then had an engineer come out and give us a brand new rooter and said the engineer who had previously installed had stapled through our wire and he couldnt understand how we had any internet atall. We rang virgin media who only refunded us Â£7 due to not having our complaint phone calls on their system. I asked to speak to a manager and they said the manager would ring me back in around 20 minutes after already being on hold for 45 minutes explaining the story to 2 different people... this was a fortnight ago and still no call. I will not be renewing my contract!,2.0
2465,"Absolutely ridiculous experience with this lot. When I initially bought the package they told me that everything was set up and good to go. 3 hours later and nothing was working. So I phoned up their customer service team and then proceeded to spend 90 minutes on the phone to them, during which time I was passed to 5 separate departments (only 2 of which possessed even the flimsiest grasp of the English language) before we finally spoke to someone who managed to get us started. It transpired that someone had forgot to activate something on their end. Still, we got the problem sorted and, whilst it was a horrible introduction to the company, mistakes happen.  Things were ok for a day or two after that, but then problems starting appearing again. Whole stretches of hours when there was no internet connection in the entire house and the router needs to be reset about every 15 picoseconds to establish even 5 minutes of decent connection to the internet. I'd call up to have this investigated, but I honestly can't bring myself to speak to their customer service again after the horrific experience I had last time.  Avoid Virgin Media like the plague.

Terrible customer service they cant be bothered to send an email telling us why or what they are doing to fix the issue, i have to keep chaing them.

This after being a loyal continuous customer for over 15 years. Unfortunately I have moved to a new build property and Virgin cannot provide a service at my new address as they have no cables here.   They have however sent me a bill expecting me to pay Â£75.00 termination fee for cancelling the remaining 3 months of the said contract.  When I called them today to dispute this, I was met with rude stsff who kept me waiting over 10 minutes to speak to a manager.  When said manager came on the line she was equally rude and continuously talked over me when I challenged her statement which was and I quote ""You are required to stay in the same property for the full duration of your contract.  She could not justify this statement when I challenged that had I been moving to a property where they could provide a service that statement would not apply.  In my view it is Virgin that are in breach of this contract because they are unable to provide a service. I have asked that they waive these charges but they have refused.  The so called manager had no people skills, had certainly not had any training in conflict resolution and was down right rude.   The call was apparently recorded and I would suggest that any senior management reading this should listen to it.  I am quite happy for this to go to court where I would like Virgin to explain how I am responsible and to justify being told that you can't move house as long as you have a contract with them.

2521,"first of all -the positive- when it works, it's very good value. However, When it doesn't, you learn what a cowboy operation VM is.Our installation took three attempts. And even then not done to our satisfaction. It was simple - come to the house, connect us with a new cable from street to house and clearly hide it under the garden.. engineers really took the mickey -many excuses..not knowing they needed cable, not knowing they needed to dig! Final time I called customer service in advance and said if not executed properly we'd cancel. Message got through. Engineer acknowledged he was there to dig (had a shovel and all)... but the sly git just dug at front of garden then ran the cable hidden through a hedge to the side of house. Cowboys!That for me was all I needed to know about VM. Said to self rather than keep calling, we'd sit out contract then jump ship. Was on a good deal so no probs sitting out.So for last 18 months....Tv service (TiVo) really slow. And we are in an 'over-utilised' (AKA they've taken on more customers than bandwidth can manage) area. Our whopping 200mb connection hits the dizzy heights of about 150 at around 4am and languishes at about 5-20 pretty much whenever we actually need to use it in evenings and weekends. Some Other customers fare much worse than this. Virgin simply fob people in areas such as this off for months, sometimes years. Anything else this mis-sold would be earning me compensation by now...So, PLEASE check virgin forums to see if your area is overutilised-virgin will not tell you...In summary -we're ready to jump ship now, and if it helps to put things in perspective, we will be moving to an openreach provider giving 22meg. (Only around 10% of what virgin offer for same price)  Because we know that if we don't get that we can cancel. With virgin, you're trapped and they know it.Having worked in customer services /marketing would say Virgin is all words, no action. I'd guess their engineers are just targeted on number of visits, not actually fixing things and that customer service are there to take calls, not do what customers want. So classic activity over customer outcome. Companies like that only really take notice when they stop making so much money. I look forward to facilitating that process.",1.0

I've just cancelled the Â£42 a month I've been using: Â£19.99 for phone and Â£23 for broadband. If you pay the bill late you get charged Â£10, you have no service, they ruin your credit rating for just a couple of days late/promise to pay.

Their attitude very evidently from talking to customer care about this twice was that they'll get the same amount of money from me anyway, so why should they provide the extra service. One of the reps, on being told that I was not happy in general with the activation issues (which I have never faced with Sky or EE) and delay in activation along with the hub issues, and that I might think of cancelling, actually challenged me to cancel the service right then.

A couple days after that, our speed was back to normal, which I enjoyed for till Friday this week (had me down to 4Mbps).

They told me their basic rubbish to fix the problem and told me that whenever I experienced the problem to restart the router ... I was obviously dealing with professional service to start with.  I took their advice and waited another month after which I called up and asked again what was going on, I had called up a couple of times in between when the internet was very bad and was told that there was an area error at the time, I complained again to little effect. A couple of weeks later I call up this time they sent an engineer and he then tells me that there is an area issue and it won't be fixed until January NEXT YEAR, it was the beginning of may! The engineer left after doing a couple of tests, after I spoke to customer services and they said they would ""speed"" up my internet through some kind of setting. I left it another week or so and phoned again and told them that I was very unhappy with the service and that it's unacceptable that they are not providing the service that they promised. Their reply to 3 months of very bad service, where:- I have several times of days where I can't use my internet because it is ridiculously slow.- After being, for the lack of a better word, lied at several times as they were trying not to inform us that there is this massive issue that not only affects me but everyone in the area for several months, the minimum they could have done is send an apology letter to those affected.- Being on the phone for HOURS, passed around from department to department. I was once on the phone for over an hour before I finally spoke to someone to then get the phone call cut off just after I started talking to someone, I am not saying that I was deliberately hung up on but a courtesy call back would have been nice as I had been waiting to talk to someone for a very long time and had barely talked to someone.  They then offered Â£3.50, give or take some pence, off my monthly bill for the lass 3 months I've been affected, anyone who is with virgin knows that this is nothing off the monthly bill but they can say that it is 50% off the broadband bill as the bill is broadband and landline, even though you can't get broadband without the landline. We don't use the landline, as like anyone on this age we have mobile phones. So 90% of our bill is for a feature we don't use AND IS ONLY WEEKEND CALLS. You can get unlimited calls on a mobile for very cheap these days so I fail to see why the landline costs so much! Very very dissatisfied and will leave Virgin soon and do not reply recommend them to anyone.",2.0

The box itself is just plagued with lag, slow, primitive menus and takes an age to get where you want to be. I have always been a regular user of BBC news interactive with sky... don't even bother pressing the red button on virgin. It is absolutely the worst feature by far. News clips are cut short, it's slow and awkward to navigate and it takes a life time to load. Again plagued with lag. The one thing you can guarantee with the interactive service, is that you will miss everything that you are trying to view. Hate it. TV selection is poor, tons of hidden costs and just overall piss poor. Got 5 months left before I can opt out, you should not wish your life away, but will be looking forward to getting rid. Broadband... seems OK 70% of the time, but randomly cuts off and where we are starting to live in a world where most things are connected to or require WiFi, it can get pretty frustrating.I'm a believer in good positive reviews, because we all too often focus on the negatives of a service... but I am sincerely struggling to find any positives for VM.The guy who did the install was really good though, shame about the product.",2.0

MEDIA. I am currently going through a very stressful divorce from Virgin Media after over 20 years of being a so called 'valued customer'. Well let me tell you that I don't feel valued.  AT ALL!  I have been lied to constantly, let down, suffered bad service and been passed from person to person, as well as suffering the constant automated choices each and every time I've called them.  The last time I phoned them, which was because the engineer, who was supposed to turn up on Tuesday 16 May between 8am and 1pm didn't arrive.  They didn't even bother to phone to inform me they wouldn't be coming.  What's more, on the Friday beforehand, they'd cancelled my subscription services, Sky Sports and LFC TV without consulting me!!  When I phoned to complain about the engineer not turning up and being told they couldn't come until Thursday 18th, I told them to cancel everything (Full House TV, Sky Sports, LFC TV, 200mb b/band and home phone).  They had the absolute nerve to inform me that I had a good deal (Â£274 p/mth for 2 V6 boxes and 2 TiVo boxes plus the above).  I told them it wasn't good if I hadn't received it!  When I said I was definitely cancelling, the guy I spoke to said it was a shame to leave after such a long time.  I said that's what happens when you offer such bad service.  He didn't even fight to keep my custom.  I'm surprised they have so many customers if that's the way they treat them!  I'm awaiting the Sky engineers now, who are planned to come and install my services on 1 June.  I can't wait.  I only hope that I get a better experience than Virgin have provided.  At the moment, I am struggling to trust in companies. As I said, I've been with Virgin (formerly Telewest and Blueyonder) for over 20 years.

They're completely incompetent and you put yourself at risk by getting into a contract with them because due to their own failures they could easily end up charging for equipment they lost in the return process.

I recall paying to watch the Mayweather vs Paquiao only to have the internet cut off in between missing nearly 4 rounds of boxing. Lately, the internet still cuts out and it's  always conveniently been when the customer service lines are closed. It's like I'm paying for a daily fix from an unfaithful wife haha. When ringing customer service my brother and I like to bet on a few stakes. Estimated time of wait and the number of times they'll juggle us from colleague to colleague. My brother always wins because I'm a nice guy and give people the benefit of the doubt. Wait times have averaged 30+minutes between 3-4 ""technicians"". They'd provide a fantastic radio service with the choice of playlist while on hold haha. Bottom line, my experience says stay away. The service is in no comparison to what it was years ago.

The biggest problem is wifi has become unreliable over the last 2 years. I'm frequently having to reboot the router and often find myself tethering to mobile instead. I expect the router hasn't't kept up with home tech but despite repeatedly calling CS for help, they never offered to upgrade it. Virgin Media only offered a new router the day I phoned to cancel, but by then I'd already signed up to a new broadband deal at close to half the price. Staying loyal to Virgin has cost me a fortune.

2785,"I've just switched to EE due to the fact virgin could not offer me much in the way of a new deal (I don't think they are great at looking after existing customers) and the speeds I'm getting didn't warrant paying Â£40 a month for. I paid for the 50mb speeds but got nowhere near that, downloading games on the Xbox was particularly slow. The cancellation with virgin was a nightmare they won't just accept you're ringing to cancel, starting telling me what a terrible decision moving to EE is and that I'm a 'brave lady'. Still even at that point they couldn't match the price EE offer and I had to laugh when they tried to get me to take the 100mb with them when I already told them they struggled to supply me with the 50mb I paid for.",3.0

I am currently still trying to extricate myself from my 18 month Virgin contract which finished in February and they are still sending me bills for April which I must pay ASAP ""to ensure no further action is taken"". This is despite the fact that I was given my final bill in March which I paid in full despite my reservations that how come you start off paying a month in advance and they still charge you for the following month after you leave?. I have absolutely no intention of paying their latest bill and should I hear further my son who is a lawyer will make contact with them directly - although to actually contact Virgin is nigh on impossible and if you do get thru (they can email you but you are not allowed to email them back) then to actually get anything  in the least bit comprehensible from them!!!!!

2796,"Well what can I say other than, STAY AWAY!!!  I use to be a loyal Virgin customer for years from 1998 before they became Virgin, till 2015. The service was good when it worked, but when there was a fault it took anything from a week to 3 weeks before an engineer could be send out to find the fault, at one point I was left for 3 months with no service, and was told my line from the road to the house needs replacing. On the day the engineer was booked he didn't turn up, after a huge fight with someone on the phone they send an engineer the next day and the problem was fixed in less than a half an hour. Finally when my service went down again just before Christmas 2014 and I was told I will have to wait 3 weeks before an engineer could come out and find the problem, I had enough, and changed to BT. I wish I could say that was the end of my story, but it's not. BT's service was more reliable but intermittent and just  not as fast as Virgin. When the internet went down it would be off for 10 - 15 min a couple of times a day, but all ways came back on, but irritating enough to encourage me to make the leap back to Virgin. BIG MISTAKE, HUGE!!!!!! I was suppose to switch back to Virgin on the 31 March 2017, the engineer turned up as planned. He installed everything that needed installing, but the internet would not connect. I was informed that there was a fault on the area line and the internet should come online by 6pm that evening, and with that he left. Well six o'clock game, and no internet, and along with that no TV service either. I phoned Virgin and after all the usual checks was done, I was told they will have to send out another engineer. As per typical Virgin, no engineer was available till the 7th of April 2017. Not the best way to start, but I agreed and was hopefull that I will be back online the following week.  On the 7th the engineer turned up as arranged, it took him less than 30 min to inform me that the line from the road to my house was dead and need replacing, which apparently should have been picked up the previous week and fixed, but was missed. I was then told that they will have to book another team to come and replace the line, and as this is a new instalation should happen within a week and a half and some one will phone me later the same afternoon with a date, and he was on his way by 11:30am, with me waiting for the call. No call came so by 4:30pm I phoned Virgin. From that point onwards I was send from pillar to post talkeing to several different call handlers, all vriendly and trying to help, but with no answaer for me. The last lady I spoke to Friday evening promised I would be called before 8pm with an answer, but the call never came. So this morning Saterday the 8th of April 2017 I rang up again. Was then again passed on to the relevant party, a very friendly and helpful young lady, who was left to give me the bad news that the new line will not be installed before the 31st of May 2017. I was speechless to say the least. I told her that that is absolutely unacceptable and cancelled everything there and then. I was told that I will not need to pay any cancellation fees seeing as I have not had any service from them since the day I switched to Virgin, and that they will provide me with the relevant packaging to send their equipment back. I immediately phoned BT and switched my service back to them this morning. I would have been far better of leaving well enough alone as I will now be with no internernet till my switch over date with BT witch will be on the 25th of April 2017, but at least it will be more than a month earlier than it would have been had I stayed with Virgin.  All I can say is that none of the service providers are perfect and that the lure of faster broadband speeds from Virgin sounds enticing, but until they can back that up with better customer service and more reliable and acceptable engineer appointment times. Their internet can be 10 or 20 times faster than everybody else's, but if there is no service the speed really make no difference. Maybe instead of trying to provide faster speeds than everyone ells in the market they should start by trying to deliver reliable services first. No connection will always be the slowest connection!!!!",2.0

At that point, our subscription with our previous service provider had expired and we were given a later install date of 10 April by Virgin. We have now been sitting for almost a month with no internet connection in our flat, but expecting the installation to finally occur on Monday. However, the installation was yet again postponed (with an indeterminate new date) this evening. This occurring again just one business day before the installation is due to take place.

But NO apparently not good enough,  outright told i CANNOT alter/adjust my services at all without signing a new long term contract,  despite being in my 7th year of custom with them,  Result,  terminated my services with virgin media.  so their utter ridiculousness in being unwilling to HELP ,  costs them a long time customer AND hands me over to a rival instead for the same services.  well done virgin media well done.",2.0

2805,"I joined virgin media on 17th of March after 12+ years with BT because the TV package looked better. While with BT I had NO internet/broadband issues at all but since being with virgin I have just had NO broadband at all. For the first few days I had an Ok broadband in the room where the hub is located but this disappeared if you even thought about going into another room and upstairs is a definite no go area. I phoned the engineers who said I should try manually selecting the best channel on my hub or I would need to buy boosters at my own expense. I went through all 13 channels and guess what, still no coverage anywhere other than within 2 feet of the hub. I explained that I never had this issue with BT even though the hub I had was about 2 or 3 years old and I was told that some services from virgin, like the TV packages are better but the broadband might not be so good, but you canât have it all! I bought the boosters and plugged them in but then the following day lost all service completely. Phoned the engineer again and he said it was an area outage. When I voiced my concerns regarding the fact that after only a couple of weeks with virgin I had experienced more issues than I had with BT in all the years I was with them, I was told that there were always problems but this was to be expected. I was assured my service would be back up and running by that afternoon. I got a text message telling me the issue had bee resolved and I could now enjoy the service I pay good money for. Unfortunately, NO, I still had no internet at all. Phoned the engineers today and they helpfully told me that I was right, and there was in fact no internet in my house. I was then told that an engineer would need to visit, but they didnât have anything available until Friday, 4 days later. I said this was not acceptable and asked to speak to customer services so I could terminate my contract. Spoke to customer services who offered Â£20:00 by way of compensation but I explained that this would not even cover the cost my mobile phone bills going over the data usage let alone my wifeâs or my 2 childrenâs or the cost of boosters needed just to be able to use their substandard service. I was then informed that because I had been reasonable and not cancelled my contract when I first called about poor coverage, I was now out of the 14 day cooling off period! I said I did not want to ""Cool Off"" and I had not just changed my mind, I wanted to cancel because the service I am receiving is not fit for purpose. this pointless conversation went on for what seemed like an eternity with lots of apologies but no action so I ended the conversation with a summary of events that basically it was my fault because I had been too helpful when I spent 4 hours of my life trying out different channels, with me downstairs shouting up to my wife like an idiot, asking ""What about now, anything?"" and her shouting back at me ""Worse"", ""Worse"", ""better, wait worse"" until I set it back to automatic, and then buying and waiting for boosters which just used more of my 14 day ""cooling off"" period. I should have not given them the benefit of the doubt, and just cancelled at the earliest opportunity. I can honestly say the I feel real haltered towards virgin media and will never ever ever have a good word to say about them even if by some miracle they are able to get my services up and running again on Friday. I will most definitely not be holding my breath.",2.0

2811,"Hello everyone, I've been a virgin media customer for 4 years. I have had the odd issue with faults and etc. But never really ever complained about this. Now today I had been cut off due to my bill being 4 days over due. I would always get payed 3 or 4 days after my bill was due I was well under my credit limit. This has happened to me before and when speaking to customer service agent, they would give me a little extension and take my card details. I've never had a issue with the service I received from them. I was very grateful and so was my son who loves watching YouTube. So today I called them to see if they would give me a 2 day extension. A lady called Myra from a uk call centre took my call. I asked nicely if they would be able to give me a 2 day extension. She put me on hold. With a short wait she replied NO. I can't do this for you today. You'll need to pay your balance in full now and the restriction would be lifted. I replayed back nicely to say that this wasn't an issue last time and please please could she help me out. She said you've already had an extension 4 months ago and she wouldn't be able to help me this time. I asked if I could pay half the bill as that's all I've got. She replied, that isn't not her fault about my financial situation and I should manage my money better.  I have to admit I was take back by her comment. I said sorry if your having a bad day. But I've always been a happy customer with no problems. I said when is my contact due to end. She replied to me that I'm not on a contact as it's a rolling contract. She also said that I can't threaten her with leaving as this would not make my services come back on.  So I asked to be put through to a floor manager. She replied saying they wouldnt do anything different to what she has done. SoShe thought she had put me on hold at this point. But no. She said to her  colleague next to her. ""We have another  <expletive> one who wants something for nothing. Can you please talk to him as he wants to talk to a manager.  She comes back on the line to say she had found a busy manger that would take my call.  At this point I was totally shocked and speechless. My wife next to me could also here the comment.  So a guy called David merrilees introduced himself to my by saying he was the customer service manager and he understood I was wanting an exstension on my bill. I said yes that's right. So he went on saying that he can't do anything for me and I'll have to wait 2 days until I payed my bill. I said to him that they have helped me before and why not now? He replied by saying he doesn't need to answer my question and he has nothing more to say to me. So I asked to speak to another manager. He replied NO I can't do that today. I then asked ""could you put me through to complaints department. He replied NO can't do that for you today.  By this time my wife took over from me. He was so rude and  aggressive towards my wife. Him and his colleague were both laughing  in the background. My wife said she is going to put the phone down and call back to speak to the complaints department. He said. I've now put a total block on your account. So you won't be able to call out to anyone. We did call back and we did speak to the complaints department and we raised a complaint. I don't think the guy believed us by the way we were treated intill he listened to to the recording of the whole Conversation.

2826,"Hi all, I'd like to explain my situation and how I was abused and trapped by Virgin Media. This testimony is for your help, for you to know how things are treated at VM when service faulted. I moved in my new home on the 13th of january. A technician came to install all he services and everything was working... for some days.  5 or 6 days later, the internet connection faulted. I contacted the team and they send some technicians.engineers to look after the problem. At the begining of february they called me to inform that the technician who was supposed to come at my house won't because it is a problem of network (cable in the street) and postponed the appointment to the 12 of march (more than a month later). At this stage I was very irritated because I need internet for my work so I had to suscibe more 4G data from my mobile provider. In the meantime the have debited 92Â£ from my account for the service from 13 january - 12 march, so for 5 days of working services. I asked several times for reimbursement but nothing. So the 12 march, after almost 2 months of waiting I was impatient to use my internet connect but guess what ? It was still not working. I have contacted the fault service team 2 times and they were not able to give me an answer why. The connect me to the construction team who told me they will contact me within 2 days and that the problem should be fixed betewwen 2 - 8 weeks (8 weeks again to wait!!!!!). I was exhausted and wanted to cancel to go at BT or Sky, so I called the customer services who connected me to the cancellation team. There I explained the situation and say that I wanted to cancel my subsciption without early terminate fees because the were not able to provide the service.  Oh yes, the funny thing is as the internet defaulted after 5 days and the time they send a technician to my home it was too late (more than 14 days) to cancel without fees. So the guy told me that the constuction team will contact me within 2 days and after this call if I have to wait too (more than 2 weeks) I will be able to cancel without fees. I asked him to confirm that by sendinbg me an email. He accepted but guess what ? I never recived it. 5 days later, of course nobody from the construction team contacted me, I contacted the service and someone said that the problem will be fixed on 24th of march. Wahou ! finally a date of availability of the service i am paying for but can't use And the 24th of march I think you have already guess that it was not working!!! I am more exhausted than irritated now. On monday I have again contacted the team, they said the construction team will contact me within 2 days. The didnt. Today I have contacted the team, the said me the construction team will contact me today. Again and again, the same answer and no internet. So finally I decided to contact the complaint team. I chatted with Zoe, who were very unpleasant. She told me that I have to wait 7 more working days. I said that I cannot wait anymore as I am waiting for almost 3 months now. So as your colleague told me before I wanted to cancel without early terminate fees. And what was my surprise when she told me than it wasn't possible that I have to pay more than 100Â£ for terminate my bundle!!!! I feel very trapped today. VM are taking my money, they dont provide the service and if I want to terminate I have to give more money. Is that the kinf of treatment we have to bear with this company?  I don't know what to do anymore. I continue to pay for the service, I am paying more and more 4G data from my mobile provider, and I cannot switch VM from a honest and professional provider. I hope this testominy could help those who wondering if they should go at VM.

Whilst admittedly it is super fast when it is working the percentage of the time that it is actually working is so infinitely small that it is about as useful as a waterproof teabag..I took the full package last August, phone/tv/broadband. After initially sending me a faulty TV box I managed to get the service up and running properly a month later. That is where the troubles began. Last November the broadband service started to crash regularly. Eventually they sent someone around just before Christmas who concluded that we needed a new cable installing from the road up to the house. That was finally completed on 21st February. The next day the same service started crashing again. Two weeks later an engineer came around and inspected the property, the box in the road, claimed some settings in the box in the road weren't right and it was now fixed. The next day it started crashing again. 2 days later, after paying to upgrade to the homeworks service just so I could get an engineer round in less than 10 days, the engineer came around and told me what I've quietly suspected all along and been telling the customer service reps time and again. The problem is not within my property. Its with the local network. They have a date for upgrading the network.... 27th June! These people are an absolute disgrace.

I was promised the service would be restored on 17th February, but nothing happened. I was then told it would take afurther two months. I complained to the regulator and obtained some compensation and refunds. I decided to leave Virgin and change to John Lewis Broadband, who got the new system working pretty quickly.

Passing their Ussain Bolt ads assuring how fast they are was galling. US mobile calls, which we make, aren't included in any package and are ridiculously expensive.

Tivo is laggy or locks up most of the time, a new fibre cable was fitted in the garden 5 days ago but the internet and TiVo stopped working at that point. I was told that it would be fixed that same day (did not happen after waiting in) and was then told that an engineer would fix it the following day (again no engineer and waiting in wasting a day), was then told it would be fixed in 3 days (texts and emails to confirm the times but then....NO ENGINEER AGAIN and a wasted day for my wife). Have now been told it will be in 6 days but could be earlier, we now want to leave but have been told it will cost Â£240 to leave. Even if they fix the problems we will be leaving at the earliest point that we can without having to pay an ""exit fee"". The broadband was good when it was working but the TiVo box is complete rubbish and the organization by customer service is very poor (I even had a sigh from one customer service person).

2950,"I am appalled by the way I've been treated by Virgin media! I've been a loyal customer of theirs for over 5year now. When the engineers came to install my new neighbours internet. They managed to disconnect my internet during this time. I informed them immediately as I was working from home. These charming engineers refused to fix it immediately as they wanted a new 'job number' and left- refusing to accept responsibility, leaving ransoms cables strewn across my front lawn. I thought the people at virgin would want to protect their customers by getting my broadband reconnected immediately. The customer service member I spoke to, who appears to be based in India was most unhelpful. He offered to send an engineer in a week! So this meant a week without internet access at home! I also had to argue why I refused to pay for the week I had no internet. (Apparently the logic was lost at customer service)  A second phone call eventually led me to U.K. Based personnel who seemed to be more proactive and promised an engineer out by today. After not hearing back from them, a final phone call back to helpful India, led me to being abruptly informed that things stood at me waiting for an engineer on the original date. Threats to cancel my subscription was met with 'that's ok'. I am shocked that this is the type of service I have been offered in light of virgin's mistake. In gaining one client they have lost another. I have cancelled my home's broadband and telephone connection as I am self employed and often work from home.

2953,"I took out an 18 month contract with Virgin for TV, broadband and landline under the impression (from ads etc) that they were a good company. It was really important that I had bt sports included in my package since my boyfriend is an avid football fan and we would very rarely ever use any of the other channels. I made it very clear on the original call and they said it would be fine.It took a while for them to eventually come and install but we immediately found out that bt sports hadn't been activated. I called virgin and they said they couldn't understand what was wrong so had to send another technician out to have a look all while leaving my bill at the exact same price. 2 weeks later, the technician came out he stood in my house for roughly 3 minutes while I explained what was wrong and he couldn't understand why they had sent him, it should be a simple fix over the phone. I again rang up and they fixed it there and then. I asked them what had happened, they claimed that I hadn't requested bt sports on the original call, so I asked them to listen to the call recording, which they conveniently claimed they didn't have. They refused to reduce the cost of their services considering the hassle they not only caused me but they also really annoyed their technician. I have however had an increase in my bill every few months. I have recently had it pointed out to me that our internet is very slow. To me it seemed normal because that's what I'm used to. I checked my contract and I'm paying for the 50mbp as constantly and proudly advertised, so I ran a speed check, I'm currently running on a maximum of 4mbp and have been for at least the last week since I've been checking it on a regular basis at different times of the day. More than likely it has been the same since the beginning of the contract. Virgins answer is that it's probably a fault in the area, which after looking on Facebook, it seems to be the answer they give everyone. So now I've got another technician coming out to me. I've asked if I can cancel my contract but they won't let me as I still have a few months left. My only way out is if this technician finds an issue that is irreparable. I now basically have the choice of sticking it out to the end or at least a Â£100 cancellation fee.

He also said he could sort the broadband issue out from his end, how? do they deliberately withhold your signal until you complain? The engineer arrived on 10 December, replaced the Tivo boxes in the bedroom and kitchen and said the phone will be ok but he has to do something at the exchange. Replacement TiVo box in kitchen was just as bad, taking ages to start up. broadband not much better and still no phone. With Christmas coming I left it. I called at the start of January threatening to leave as they were not delivering on what I signed up to. A third engineer arrived on Saturday 10 Jan and said that the wrong phone socket had been wired up. We now have a working phone. I signed up for 12 months in October 2016 and I will be going back to sky as soon as I get out of the contract with Virgin.",2.0
2998,"Virgin media took Â£5.00 early January 2017 yet I pay my DD 19th each month. Contacted Virgin Media to ask why.. their answer is that they have not taken the money out!! Yet my bank statement in black and white states Virgin has taken the money, complete with the same ref number as my authorised DD monthly payment. The outcome? No outcome tonight, suddenly Virgin media site froze and could not continue with online chat, I cannot phone as my Virgin media phone line does not work, So I'll have to visit (around my busy full time nurse job) my local Virgin store to cancel my subscription (been with them since 2009 and paid every month without fail) as I can no longer trust that they won't just randomly take money here and there whenever they wish from my bank account, it simply isn't on, I cannot afford random unauthorised payments that Virgin then claim they have not taken!!!!!!

It drops to between 4Mbps and 2Mbps, sometimes just over 1Mbps.  They think this is OK.  We are a charity, and some staff work evenings and week-ends. Our complaint is that such a massive speed drop is not reasonable.  They seem unimpressed. We are looking elsewhere.",2.0
3001,"The Virgin broadband service was generally quite bad, even though according to their checks (prior to my subscribing to them), the service to the flat was supposedly excellent. The reasons why I found it terrible are as follows: 1. The broadband signal frequently dropped out - multiple times per day - which was extremely irritating to say the least.2. The hub was in the living room, and when the broadband signal was available, internet access was fine in the living room. However, there was often no WiFi signal elsewhere in the flat despite the flat being small and my devices being no more than 5 metres from the hub (I found this out only because my mobile data was being drained so quickly!).3. The download speeds were far slower than I was led to believe by the Virgin team. Periodically, when I found it unbearable, they would ""boost"" things for me remotely, but the benefit was short-lived.  On the plus side (!!!), I found that their telephone customer services were pretty good (unlike BT!). Given all the above issues, I had to phone them multiple times. Everyone I spoke to was friendly and tried to help. Unfortunately, the broadband service itself leaves much to be desired. To date, I have used a number of internet providers. I would NOT go back to Virgin.",2.0

Don't choose Virgin Media if you're not 100% sure that you will stay in your property for the whole period of your contract. If you move it's a pain and they will add extra fees. It's always a long waiting time when you call in, and the service is slow and they usually put you on hold for a long time.  I called them to cancel my contract but they told me that it would be cheaper to get a new reduced contract for landline only. I told the customer service that I just wanted to pay the minimum possible cost, whether it's a cancellation cost or for a new contract I don't use. I used a 12 month contract from January to June last year and ended up paying 150 GBP to get rid off it after a lot of phone calls with Virgin Media.",1.0

On the initial call the virgin representative was nice and friendly and helped with ease. After that it was all down hill. I received an email to confirm the installation date as the 30th December perfect I was off work that day between Christmas and new year. Waited in all day no one arrived I then phoned them to find out where they were, to be told t had been moved too the 17th January no warning or call to tell me this. I had already given notice to my previous provider and my broadband was going to be switched off on the 5th January. Virgin said don't worry ring your previous provider and they will just prolong it til we come. No apology for me waiting in all day on my day off and reason was no wires to my house to connect, surely they would have known this before booking a date to come out. They then promised someone would call me back within 48 hours to discuss what had gone wrong and if they can bring the date forward. Today is the 5th January (still no call back 6 days later) so I call at 6pm on hold 17 minutes at first get through to be told nothing they could do but refer another call back. Not happy with this I said forget it I don't want you to install it for them then to say we can't cancel that I will transfer you to the pre installation team. I was on hold an hour and then the phone cut out you can imagine how furious I was. So I rang back again and an actual nice guy called joe tried to help me but again had to transfer me to same team, would you believe it like a fool I held for another hour to be yet again cut off! So again I called through this time I asked to speak to complaints or a manager and as I have the best luck ever I got the worse manager that ever walked this plant. The manager JANIC was the rudest woman I have ever spoken too. I have worked in customer service for 14 years and never been spoken too so rude in my life. All JANIC could then tell me was that the department I needed closed at 8 after been on hold 2 and half hours and nothing she could do to help me. Yes I was high rate and raising my voice but she didn't once apologise or even try to help. She repeated 'anything else I can help you with' during my ranting which obviously annoyed me more, then said I'm hanging phone up now! No I didn't swear but I did call her a ball sack before she managed to put the phone down. I expect she didn't refer my call back.  The customer service is less than poor and I honestly wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. Good luck any one joining!!!!!",2.0

Well, three months later when I was arranging for them to do the installation (basically just flipping a few switches) it turns out that they could not service us. They cancelled our contract - fair enough, I thought - and then hit us with a Â£250 disconnection change. We were livid. We tried many times to call them to discuss this as we though it unfair but it was just impossible to speak to them. Then, without warning and only a couple of weeks after the initial disconnection bill, they sent in the debt collection companies. We paid it there and then but under duress. Our previously-perfect credit record is now obliterated and since we needed to upgrade our car urgently, we were refused the loan.

3017,"VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICEONCE YOUR PAST YOUR COOLING OFF THIS COMPANY DOESNT CARE. I have two main points of complaint which have not been rectified and should lay with the telecoms provider.  1)During the installation of my new telephone line i realised that virgin media was making an entirley new telephone port. I advised the engineer to stop and i communicated across to them that my alarm system was built into the original telephone port and by making a new one it would effect my alarm system. They advised that they could not do anythign with the alarm system which i responded that they should cease the installation and i will cancel my contract as i was within my cooling off period. They contacted their installation manager who visited my property and advised that he will return to connect up the alarm system to the new telephone port. I agreed with this as he was representing virgin media management. The installation manager never returned. Virgin Media refuse to accept liability that due to the installation managers advise i accepted the installation. I was misrepresented and coerced into accepting the installation. The virgin Media customer services have advised they will not help or do anything about this issue. I am without a working alarm and although Virgin Media is not an alarm company a representative from their company accepted responsibility to recitfy my issue in return for not cancelling the install.  2) During my initial acceptance of virgin media services over the phone i was advised that a temporary cable would be placed on my drive which after a second visit would be inbedded under my drive. Virgin Media has agreed a number of dates with me a failed to recitfy this. I have now been advised by the ceo office that they would not be imbedding the cable under the drive. I find this rediculous and a health hazard as part of the cable is on the public footpath and the public can trip over this which has happened with the mail man on a number of occasions.  I find Virgin Medias lack of responsibility and loyalty appauling and it has left me in a position where i cannot leave my home for long and i have become thoroughly fed up and stressed out with the poor level of service from virgin media.",2.0

3024,"Virgin ratings based on all the things you are looking for. Package/sales - GoodBroadband speed - Good However as I soon came to realise the additional add ons  Automated phone system - They love to go through full background history check and pressing numbers, before you come anywhere close to get to the right department. So yes it is far too long winded and says thanks after every button you press which soon becomes a pest. So make sure your not in a rush and are patient and mentally prepare yourself for the call maybe a few stretches would be good release some tension. Customer services - The worst on the planet full of fake answers. There favourite line is ""will look into this for you and call you back"" But after numerous calls I've had and the call backs I've requested I'd say a good 1/10 call you back. aswell as that you can not always understand what there saying as it's another outsource company who are given guidelines to follow who actually offer no help apart from what you already know. Engineers - well upon installation you get advised a date which is great. So I booked a Friday off work to be told there going to be late. However 3pm they turn up due to the size of the job they couldn't start so a wasted day for myself and adios to a days annual leave. Best part is when they turn up and don't even tell you there leaving until their 30 Minutes down the road on the friday. Sales - Sell you a great deal like Â£100 off your total costs. Which was said at the time your first bill and part of your 2nd bill will be free which is great news. But you guessed it I got a bill for 60 quid the first month to which i raised the issue and I was advised this will be sorted for the next 2 Months bills. I generally can't even remember their excuse that day guys sorry. However the 2nd month you guessed it I got another bill of you guessed it 60 quid after being promised this won't happen. Clearly they don't give a toss about your issue they just advise you what you want to hear. Their is clearly within Virgin obvious miscommunication between sales and customer service but after 3 months we finally came to a conclusion. I had to pay a one off fee of 70 quid and ended up getting my 100 quid by stopping the line rental for 10 months at 17.99.  They also say free Netflix for 6 months so any normal human being would think it comes free with the virgin box however doesn't tell you, you need to call them and set up your own account. Nor any paperwork giving you a guide when they sell you these deals of how to set up these add ons. So once again I end up speaking to the customer service team to find out what code you need to do it so another military option going round the houses within virgin to find the right person to speak to before being toldTo phone netflix and doing your own install with the pin they provide you.  Today CHRISTMAS DAY I might add - router stuck on green flashing lights. I phone virgin they advise there's nothing they can do soI am stuck without wireless until the 28/12 when an engineer is available which is what I was advised. But don't worry virgin customer service gods never fail. Until I phoned backTo see if there was anything they could do over the phone as it's Christmas they said an engineers will be appearing on the 31/12???? I was just told the 28/12 so the conversation once again turned sour. So that's me without virgin all over the festive season lucky me and thank you virgin for a great year. I hope you are making many resolutions for 2017 That's that folks you really couldn't make it up I have had it with virgin i wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to virgin I would steer clear of these shambles.

I rang customer services and explained the situation and told them I did not schedule a technician to come out that day or time and gave him the order number but said unable to find my order yet a technician was sent to my house randomly.

3054,"Don't get Virgin!!! Installation was supposed to have occurred a week ago. Despite having had 3 weeks to check if external cabling was function, they left it till day when they cut my existing phone line and broadband. A car was parked on a manhole preventing them from feeding cable through, so contractor left and that was the last I heard of them. I have spent a week calling Virgin repeatedly. They have not managed to call me once to inform when or if installation will ever occur. Still not clear. Why cut my phoneline and internet when they could easily have checked cabling before installation, then absolutely no urgency to resolve. The contracts with external contrators obviously favour smooth installation so if there is any problem contractor can just dump job with no penalties. Customer service is designed to ensure you can never speak to anyone with any authority to do anything except to say you have to wait for 48 hours for something or nothing to happen (nothing in my case). They are not allowed to call out so if you get a direct line to relevant dept rather than passing round vast numbers of call centres, you are charged for phone call. In all Virgin milk customers who have no problems, but provide zero service in those cases where there are problems. That is the business model.",2.0

I was told this would take two engineers and I would have to wait 12 weeks. I then called and asked to cancel my account. The incredibly incompetent people they have answering their phones promised that two engineers would be sent the Friday of that week to do an install. I took half the day off work (unpaid) to ensure I would be there. They sent one engineer who was unable to connect the the line. He queried this and, yep, a 12 week wait for the two engineers. At this point I cancelled my account and they had the sheer nerve to ask for a Â£240 early disconnection charge. For a service that was never even connected! Thankfully, I persuaded them to drop this charge. I then went with a different provider and was online a week later. Since then, Virgin have sent out two engineers (who were sent away), contacted me as a 'valued former customer' and, the day before yesterday, sent me a text to expect more engineers tomorrow! To do work on my non-existent line! This company is just a joke. The people on the phones lie to you and don't know what they're talking about.

3107,"I am currently writing this review using my mobile phone data, as for the sixth time in the past two weeks, for no known reason my Virgin Media 200Mbps service is down. You would expect a 200Mbps service to also run fairly rapidly too, yes? You'd think so, but for the past month the extortionate amount of money in paying is impressive if it ever exceeds 10Mbps.  I have contacted customer support on several occasions, and every single time I'm told about some sort of ""work"" in the area or given some other, equally dismissive excuse, yet when I check out my broadband service status on their website it hilariously claims ""there are no known faults with your service"". I have been offered neither refund or explanation outside of the generic ""work in the area"" or ""utilisation"" or, as the really helpful woman told me last week ""there are no issues with your Internet, it is running fine"" as I sit in front of my computer, and router being told there is no connection to a local DNS and the router blinks it's typical ""I am not connected"" light show.   Previously I've had very few issues with the service, but when it goes wrong, it goes catastrophically wrong. You are either one of the lucky ones and receive a full five-star service, or you, like me, pay high amounts of money for less than a percentage of the speed you expect, and then get dismissed when you ask them to fix it.  If you go with Virgin expecting some semblance of quality, in both service and support, I'm beginning to believe you'd be sorely mistaken. You would be better off taking the Â£80 or whatever it is they charge most people for their ""high speed service"" these days and setting the money on fire. You'd get more use out of it that way. You can cook, warm yourself up and clear a forested area for yourself to built a hut and live in the wild, because you would still be getting the same Internet service.    Apologies for any formatting issues, typos and the like, as stated, I'm having to post this on my mobile, as the only reliably speedy Internet I have currently is my mobile data...",2.0

3165,"Avoid! We have been paying for a 200mb service, which for the last 14 months has been operating steadily worse and worse.  It was great for 6 months but then started to deteriorate. We do get 200mb, but only during off-peak times.  During peak hours we max out around 40 if we are lucky, but regularly drops to 2 or less. At these times our upload speed drops well below the usual 10-12mb and our ping can reach as high as 900!  This means all downloading and online gaming grinds to a halt. When we download files on one PC, the latency increases to 900 and the other 2 PC's on the network are essentially unable to use the internet. In April 2016 we called and were told the problem is due to our local area being saturated since Sept 2015, it should be fixed Sept 2016.  When we called in Oct 2016 saying the BB was still getting worse we were told the date for the fix was Nov 2016. We eventually managed to register a complaint by email (their contact info says it's not possible to register a complaint by email! I would love to see what OFGEM say about this...) but did manage to find a complaints email address in the end.  Needless to say Virgin didn't respond to the email even though we received a delivery and read receipt within 2 minutes of the email being sent.  After the obligatory 5 working days without getting a reply we then called them, and they advised our complaint has been escalated to a manager and we will receive a call in 3 working days.  That 3 working day period finished yesterday and we have not received the promised manager callback. We are outside of our contract end date so we could switch, and we have had our monthly bill reduced by the statutory Â£12 for sub-standard service, but we want something done to actually fix the problem and I no longer believe the statutory minimum is sufficient after 14 months of problems. After reading 4 solid pages of complaints on here I have zero expectation we will get what we want and deserve. Their call centre staff have always been polite and patient, and all based in the UK, however they are unable to fix the issue. I believe their contention ratio must be through the roof due to over-selling and I'm really unhappy with their price increases.",3.0

Not to sound racist but it would be very helpful if the staff had English as their first language. This matter has taken up time and energy, as well as causing unnecessary stress. The staff do not listen to the customers needs and even one of the members of staff accused myself of lying about how I ordered my current phone.

My broadband was dropping off 3 to 6 times a day, I have called virgin they said that it was an issue with the street and couldn't do anything about it. The TV box was really small, everything was bad.Then they decided to increase the price of my package but I could cancel with no fees if I wanted to (a per their email). So I have decided to cancel, I called them on 16th September, the person was very helpful and told me that it will be cancelled in a month. I got charged on the 6th October for the full amount of a normal month (ok with that) then I received a letter crediting me for the extra money I have paid as I have paid for a full month but should have been charged only until the 16th + they added termination fees of Â£172. i contacted their customer service, I had a very helpful person who said that it will be fixed and I will received a personal cheque with the credited amount. Unfortunately that did not work and I have received another bill for the previous amount including the termination fees. I called again and I a very unhelpful person who did not understand they owned me a credit so she wanted to do a credit of what I thought I owned them but not give me back my first credit... long story short, she couldn't understand so I gave up, calling twice in 1 week i a bit too much for me. After hanging off, I realised that it was really unfair and that if they do that do me a relatively young person, who do older people manage if they don't understand their bill. I thought Virgin is a big enough company to not steal from their customers so I have decided to be brave and call again.

3191,"!!!Virgin Mobile charged me Â£44 for only 300MB internet!  I was charged Â£44 for only 300MB I've used at Virgin Mobile. Let me explain how this happened.   I was originally calling Virgin Media this summer to stop its broadband contract from re-occuring automatically after the contract expiry date, while somehow was transferred to the Virgin Mobile team where the staff induced me into signing up the Â£5 contract deal with virgin mobile.The contract was agreed over the phone call where I was not having the contract with me, the only way I could know about the terms and conditions of the package deal was through what the staff had told me. The staff only informed me what was included in the Â£5 monthly deal but DID NOT tell me that there would be a Â£2 charge per day after I reached the package's internet limit as long as the mobile data is 'on' in the mobile's settings. This means even if you have not used your browsers at all (which means you have used almost 0MB data), you'll still be charged Â£2/day. This is undoubtedly a very crucial commercial information which would have influenced my decision of choosing whether or not to enter into this contract, yet the staff omitted to tell this information to me.  Apart from this, at that time I was having a monthly deal with another mobile company which just started, so I told the staff that I would be paying twice if I sign the contract with Virgin Mobile on that day. However, the staff said that she would send me a cheque which covers the expense of that other mobile company's service so that I would not be paying twice, I singed the contract yet never received the cheque.Also, the staff did not tell me we'll have to pay Â£5 in order to start the contract. I used to trust Virgin Mobile and therefore I signed the contract on that day based on all these information. I have received text messages informing me that I have used up all of the package's monthly data, BUT, unlike what most of the other mobile companies do, the message also NEVER told me about the Â£2 charge thing.  ******Therefore, based on trade customs, I assumed that I would only pay for the data I have used.    Never expected that for the past two months, I have been charged Â£44 in total for only 300MB extra while 300MB only worth Â£3 according to Virgin Mobile's 'pay as you go'!!! ******I cannot believe that I was charged more than 10 times of the actual worth of the service which is definitely an unfair commercial behaviour  Yet when I called Virgin Media, they simply said as I signed up the contract there is nothing I can do about it.  I'm very disappointed and scared by this service therefore I stopped the monthly package and now I don't want to have anything to do with Virgin Media as I feel very insecure about their potential 'landmines' hidden behind their tricky business veil.  I hereby sincerely warn all Virgin Mobile Customers to be very careful about their service, and to get to know about all the key details of the service by ourselves instead of simply relying on what the staff tell us during the negotiation service.  ******We defo should protect our rights and FAIRNESS we are ENTITLED TO as CUSTOMERS!!",2.0

Worse, Virgin never checked the connection when I moved in.  They will not fix the problem until end of November, yet gladly have been charging me full price. Shockingly, customer service suggested I check the speed every day and call them every time if was under par. For me, that suggests that, in the staff's experience of the service and customer complaints about speed, they have no trust or confidence in the service.  Customer services told me that checking their customers' actual line speed before they started using it was not good business sense for Virgin Media. They were right - with an incredibly high margin of reportedly around 50%, unheard of elsewhere in retail, it's clear that gouging customers is one of its best ways to make a fast buck.  Now that the brand has totally lost its luster for me, and with so many operators offering unlimited 38MB and above, I have no problem - except sour taste and hassle - leaving the greedy and cynical Virgin Media behind.",2.0

3228,"After 9 years of being with Virgin Media I have now finally left them and just joined up with Sky. Never known a company with such poor communication between not only me and them, but also between them and their colleagues!  I moved house 3 weeks ago and when my installation for transferring my services came there was a problem. The cable that runs under my drive way was basically damaged. Virgin media wanted to dig up my drive, being a newly brought property with a newish driveway I refused. Several different engineers even told me that Virgin Media will make a mess of the drive. So at this point I spoke to an area manager whom we discussed an alternative route for new cables to be laid.  I was told the cables needed to be laid before my new installation date and that someone would be out. This didn't happen and I continuously rang them up until my new installation date on the 27th September to say that my cables still hadn't been laid. I was assured that the engineers coming to do my installation would be laying the cables and doing the installation.  Surprise supirse when the 27th September came (yesterday) the engineers turned up and said they aren't qualified to lay new cables and are only here to connect my boxes up. They then rang the area manger that I had previously spoken to, he assured me that a construction team would be out that day to lay the cables so the two engineers that were here could complete their job. Guess what, that never happened, these poor engineer guys kept coming back out during the day to complete their job only to find everytime that the construction team still hadn't been!  I then rung and complained as was assured by a lady at the technical team that the installation would be completed by the end of the day. So 5pm came and the area manager decided to ring me and ask me ""Are you sure you don't want us to dig up your drive?"" This is a question he had already had an answer to over 2 weeks ago when I told them NO. I them asked if the team were on their way and he said no he had been in a meeting all day so was unable to arrange it!! This was a blatent lie aswell as several times when the engineers arrived here throughout the day they was on the phone to him! So he basically had no intention of arranging this work to happen even though he had 2 weeks to do so after my first installation was meant to happen.

Like many others reporting here, I have had constant issues with the speed, connection lag and the overall TV package. The TIVO box often hangs or records stuff I have not asked it to record, whilst not recording the shows I ask it to record. The on demand has regularly gone down particularly in the first two months of service. It uses a thumbs up or down system to learn what you may like to watch, however my box gives a thumbs down to ones I like and although it was funny at first I spend ages deleting programmes I did not want. The house phone is a white elephant. I did not want it in the first place, no one I know calls me on it, however it is a perfect medium for all the PPI and accident chasing cold callers. I have regularly made my thoughts known to Virgin who on two occasions offered to compensate me, then increased the bills! They clearly know the service is not up to standard, because when I ring in the first thing I hear is someone telling me ""we can see that there are service issues in your area,  blah blah"". This is month 6 and I had enough. They promptly charged me Â£230 to cancel the remainder of the contract. I tried to tell the company, that I have not received a satisfactory service or any compensation for that, so I felt it was a cheeky asking me to pay that much for cancellation. On a few occasions I could not understand some of the customer service advisors as their spoken English was not good enough to be a call handler.  I used to think that Virgin was the best of the providers; unfortunately this last few months has put me off ever using them again.

It always goes down usually for around 15 minutes but sometimes can be hours, when we phone to get it sorted they say they are going to sort it and still take ages. I wouldn't normally moan but it's happened a lot. I feel they take advantage of the fact that he is young and don't really understand what they are saying even when he says he don't understand they baffle him with more crap. They have sent people out to sort it out and it still isn't sorted. They just do the same things over and over again. I don't feel that this is on considering he pays nearly Â£70 a month and only really uses the Internet. He has tried to reduce the bill multiple times and once it has come down by around Â£8, as they always find something that they convince him he needs. And now we have to wait for another engineer to come out, who we have to wait for until at least tomorrow which will be at least 24 hours with out service AGAIN. They usually take a couple of pounds off the bill if we have to wait until the next day, but I don't feel it is on paying for Internet that don't work all the time when he pays for a service.

3264,"So I want to preface this review with a few points. June - Upgraded from 120mb/s package to 200mb/s package.Phone calls - 5xEngineer visits 2x (One upcoming) So, after upgrading in June our speed dropped to less than 2mb/s on download but upload remained the expected 10mb - 12mb/s. One of the phone calls I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was put on hold for 40 minutes before calling from another phone. When they upgrade my package they apparently only done 'half a job' as well as not arranging for a Superhub(v3) to be sent out. I was informed on the 4th phone call that my Superhub(v2) was not compatible with the package that I ordered (3 months after I started paying for the service). This is by no means meant with racism or disrespect of countries or cultures, but as an English person I would be very appreciative to speak to a fellow English person.Spoke to maybe 12 different people, one was English, the other were of Asian decent (sounded as though from India) and 3 of them I really struggled to get a good understanding of over the phone. The only redeeming factor is that one of the supervisors I had spoken too was very good at the 'I am doing the best to help your situation' spiel - I nearly fell for it. I will be switching ISP as Virgin Media are THE worst in the country.Edit",3.0

Appalling customer service with rude support staff in India out of hours - just don't even bother phoning. You'll be placated with BS made up on the hoof by whomever you happen to be talking to. Whilst the single redeeming feature of Virgin's service is that broadly honest and knowledgeable engineers can and do (eventually) visit in case of faults, this is nullified by the fact that their escalations for specialist intervention are simply ignored so problems invariably persist. I cannot recommend opting for another supplier strongly enough; I will be switching now at long last - believe me, we are lazy users so it must be pretty bad for it to come to this!

3273,"Been with Virgin since they took over Blueyonder 10 years back. Up until 18 months ago I couldn't really fault them.  Always been quick to fix and resolve issues,  along with numerous speed bumps over the years.  However their aggressive expansion of customer numbers has led to a severe dip in quality due to contention/over subscription.  Since early 2015 we've experienced issues from 4pm till long after midnight every day.  I'm on a 50mb connection which during this time will max out at maybe 5mb. In effect under 10% the advertised speed.  Finally complained after 12 months of waiting for some fix to be told in March there was a known fault.  Now this fault was pushed back month after month and now I'm told is due to overcapacity. They also advised the speed upgrades are being cancelled for my area due to this issue.  My problem here is that they have an issue which they are not sharing with their customer base.  It took many phone calls and staff to get to the root of the problem and they will only refund you Â£7.50 per month, if you call.  So I have to waste time calling once every fix date has passed to go through the whole dance again and again,  repeating the exact same conversation.  I was hoping the speed dip was related to the work on providing the speed upgrades (given thats what I've been led to believe my price increases are for).  Sadly however it's not the case.  Basically if you are a new customer I'd steer clear until they get to grips with the over selling as their network is falling apart.   If I could I'd go to BT,  but sadly they max out at 38mb.",1.0

3285,"Virgin media is the worst service provider since Elizabethan plumbing (there wasn't any). After years of harassment over the phone and via mail to switch from sky, promising more channels and faster broadband and a cheaper landline, we decided to give it a try and save money. Huge mistake. It took a week of no broadband and no tv and three or four engineers, all on separate occasions that I had to call spending hours on my mobile with customer service to book each of them, and on two occasions no-one turned up, they just told me they booked one to get me off the phone. When they did turn up they started messing about with the neighbours wires as well as our own before we got even one channel and it was very glitchy. Eventually, and after 3 missed days of pay waiting for engineers who sometimes didn't turn up or did turn up but without the right equipment and had to come back a day later, that got sorted. However, the phone line still hasn't been installed because despite their advertisements flooding this area, they don't even have the government permission to install virgin phone lines in our area! They said if they do get permission (at all) it will take at least until the end of October! It was meant to be installed in August! We can't even use the phone for emergency numbers (which as I'm pregnant I will need soon). If I had any idea how much trouble it would be I'd never have switched, what's the point saving money if you don't get even a basic service or a truthful customer service hotline out of it. If that guy at work no-one can stand mentioned he was getting the virgin media package I would advise him against it because not even a twit like him deserves this much agro.

We have had several engineers out to make sure that it was not our 'SUPER HUB', but apparently there is nothing wrong with it. We then called to complain again and they told us they can send us the newest addition of the 'SUPER HUB' which is giving us less internet than before and only allows you to get access in the room that the hub is in. But they still say that it is because so many people use it at peak time, considering it is currently 7.30am and I cannot load a 5 minute video and I am the only person in the house it is just not acceptable.

After talking to customer services i was offered Â£3 off my monthly bill. I also asked for some guarantees on the permit and was told they always go through on the second request. 2 weeks later i called up to make sure everything was set to go ahead the next day.

The guy was pretty helpful and told me the problem was probably to do with if the pavement outside my house had recently been laid. I called the cancellation team to cancel. The first guy i spoke to guaranteed construction would start that week, but the actual install wouldn't take place for another 2. ""you will definitely see our van outside your house connecting the cable boxes within 3 days"". He also told me that he'd reduce my contract down to a 12month one. I decided to keep it in place, as all other providers would also take 2 weeks. I then did some shopping around and went back on the virgin website to compare. They'd just reduced their contracts to 12months and cost down to the same Iâd been offered. So basically they'd just offered me the new rate. I called the cancellation team back. A gentleman then said the rate i was going to get was actually Â£11 off my original rate. So Iâd be paying Â£30 a month for 12 months, which was pretty good. Also he promised to send through my new contract showing all this asap.  3 days went by and there was no van, construction or contract.  I signed up with BT who would install 2 days after if the 4th attempt didn't happen. 3 days before the install i could see no visible signs of ""light construction"" on any of my street or near the cable boxes. I cancelled and will never be using them. At the end of the day if someone had said ""The permit to start works outside your house might take 2months. When it's approved we'll contact you to arrange a date for install"" i'd of happily waited. Instead they just lied to me.",1.0

The man then advised us that we could cancel our parents' virgin account because they were no longer in a contract, and we all agreed that would be a good idea. Once this was agreed by all parties, a representative rang our parents, was very rude and refused to share any information about our account, meaning that we couldn't set up for our account to be moved at all. Finally, we gave up and moved our tv and internet package over separately, keeping the parents' package too, assuming this would be the easiest path, but no.

We then received a text on the Monday stating that our connection day had been cancelled (with no explanation) and that they would get back to us. We were disappointed but understood that these things happen. My Dad drove the 50 minute drive to work, and received a text from Virgin asking him to be in and that we were indeed being connected that Tuesday, he drove all the way home, waited all day and no one turned up. Earlier on in the day, our current provider BT had turned us off, in preparation for Virgin to reconnect us, so we had to WiFi in the house. We rang up Virgin and was told due to a technical fault the connection had to be postponed. We waited and waited to hear from Virgin, and when we rang up to enquire the customer service was extremely unhelpful and nobody could tell us anything. We have now been without WIFI for 3 weeks, and still no word from Virgin, even with going in to store and ringing up. It got to the point where we needed WIFI and were fed up, my Mum is a teacher and cannot do her work at home without the connection so is working late at work. 3 weeks with no word and no connection is appalling. We decided to give up and reconnect to BT, bearing in mind that we had to pay a disconnection charge beforehand and also paid Virgin. It will take another week or so to be connected, which means due to Virgin we have been without WIFI for a month. They then had the cheek to ask to connect us and wanted to give us a connection date! Considering we were supposed to be connected on the 31st of May and it's now the 23rd of June, I think this is disgusting.

Still waiting. I've just checked my credit score and virgin's put a note that I'm Â£90-odd in arrears on there. My question is, how do I sort this out? Virgin won't communicate in writing, it's all via phone calls - I've been on the phone to virgin for at least 10 hours since February. I work full time and have two young children, having to talk to virgin during the working day or in the evening is a hassle I'd rather not have, especially as I keep getting passed from pillar to post, I've been called a liar (by the person who said I answered the phone I was disputing), my credit rating's being affected by their incompetence and they say I can't cancel my contract without being charged.",3.0

However, Virgin still think I should pay a late cancellation charge of Â£200 because I am still within my contract.

At best you get 50% of the speed they advertise, apparently only a small percentage of their customers need to get 100MB for them to claim that all customers get this service, but the reality is that you normally get 10MB-15MB. The mobile phone service drops out as many times as you get a connection and you get more Free to View TV channels on an open decoder than Virgin provide in their package. It seems to be a legalised form of theft to charge for Free to Air channels, but that is what they do, as indeed do the rest.Long and the short is that Virgin offer an overcharged mediocre service, but are little different to the others.

3459,"Tried to install Virgin superfast broadband in my new home after being pleased with the fast speed in my old home and putting the lengthy delays for installation down to one-off problems that would not be repeated.  Total nightmare! Booked installation on three separate occasions.  On each day, you are asked to take a half day off work but nobody turns up and the format of my day was identical: 1. Lots of promises from a helpful sounding phone team all day long  that the technician was on his way to my home, held up but would definitely come albeit late.  Every time that you phone them, you are made to wait for 10 - 40 minutes (whilst paying for the call if your Virgin phone line is not yet installed). 2.  Around 7pm to 8pm each day, the technicians switch off their phones and go home.  The helpdesk people then admit that they cannot get through to the installation men any longer and ask you to call back in the morning to rebook another installation day.   3. Call back next day (another long wait to be answered), only to be promised the ""first available new installation date"" a couple of weeks away. 4. This cycle repeats itself endlessly with no actual installation. Other issues are: a) your contract arrives with a higher price than you agreed to.  This also occurred on every occasion that I renewed at my old address.  You phone up, only to find that your old price has mysteriously disappeared from their system and settle for a new price.  A contract for this lower price is promised but NEVER arrives.  Result: the only paperwork that you possess is for a much higher price than you ever agreed to. b) Issue (a) above is irrelevant really because one or two months into your 12-18 month fixed price contract, Virgin will increase your prices anyway.  Expect two or three price rises during your 12-18 month ""fixed price"" contract as this is what I regularly had at my old address.  Each time, you have the right to threaten to leave (without penalty) and renegotiate a new contract, but of course this involves the long wait for the helpdesk and hassle that you could do without. (c) If you find yourself still having no installation after three booked appointments, you switch to another broadband provider and then have to argue with Virgin to get your money back, with more promises of new dates for installation. Yes, the service is fast and cheap if you ever actually finally get it installed and are willing to fight over the price every 3-4 months, but if you actually want a reliable installation with a company that you can trust, then Virgin Media is not for you.",2.0

3487,"Where to begin. I signed up to get Virgin Media Vivid 100 on the 29th February, three and a half weeks ago, after one of the webchat team said my house was able to get it. The installation day was 11th March, I was asked to be here from 9am, so I took a day off work unpaid. The installation team turned up and said they needed to send their manager round to take a look and they went away. A few hours later a van pulled up outside and the supposed manager got out, expecting him to ring the doorbell or call me, I didn't go out, and next thing I knew the van had gone again and bright green spray paint had been sprayed all down the road with a big arrow pointing at my house. No one contacted me to let me know what was going on, despite a manager coming round. I was in all day and had to call customer service three times and speak to various people before I found out that a note had been left on the account that construction work would need to be done before the installation could take place. I said there and then that I wanted to cancel it but was passed on to a cancellations guy who practically begged me to stay with Virgin Media, reducing the monthly cost, who assured me everything would be done and installed two weeks later. So today, the 24th was booked as installation day, I took another day off work, unpaid, so that I could be here, as requested, to meet the installers. So three and a half weeks have gone by since I was told I could get Virgin Media internet, in those three and a half weeks, 1 installation team and 1 manager have visited the property. 13 days have gone by since I was told construction would be complete and I would have Internet set up by the end of today. I had a text from Virgin at 9am this morning, confirming that an installer was going to visit. The end of the day comes, no one has contacted me or visited, so I call customer service and after speaking again to three different people from three different departments, I find out that a team visited yesterday and decided the construction work couldn't be done. No one bothered to call me, text me or email me to let me know that! I was told some team did try to contact me today but couldn't get through which is completely unbelievable seeing I have been making and receiving calls fine all day, but instead I got a text this morning confirming it was going ahead as planned and was led to believe that all day as no one reattempted to contact me, by email, text or phonecall. I received no contact ALL day from Virgin Media to let me know that or to apologise for the complete goose chase I have been led on, the dire lack of communication in general, and the huge inconvenience of having to take two unpaid days off work. I've lost Â£140 from my paycheck and waited nearly a month for absolutely nothing. I am then recommended by the website to make a complaint over the phone, and am told after speaking again to multiple people, that I can't make a complaint or receive any compensation because my account has been cancelled!

I complained to the head office, and recieved no acknowledgement or apology. I then phoned in, and was told they will get back to me....the only time they got back to me was to tell me that my bill was going up AGAIN!!!.

3594,The broadband service itself is fair to good but the customer service is shocking and when a sales advisor tells you a price is fixed it is a bare faced lie. They can raise your bill by whatever price they seem fit at any point they like because it says they can in the ts and cs therfore once your stuck in a contract you have no choice but to pay (as it was for me) a near Â£10 increase over 6 months,2.0

3600,"Disgusting service from Virgin Media.From the 1st day I have had nothing but issues with them. They failed to inform me that there was no phone line in the area at the time of taking out the contract therefore had to charge me the Installation fee for the broadband, long story short they are still making incorrect charges to my account as they cannot get their act together. The extra charges however are the least of my worries, having been mis-sold the 50mb broadband package they are not failing to meet their end of the contract, the most signal I am getting now is 0.25mb!! Called them numerous times only to be told I need to purchase a signal booster off them to get a reasonable speed.  Needless to say I was not happy with this solution. Several calls later they informed me that the sales rep should have stated that there was a line issue in the area prior to taking out a contract with them. They assured me they were applying to the council for new lines to be installed early last year, called again before xmas to be told its being delayed till later summer 2016. 10 months of my contract paying for 0.25mbps of so called broadband! Please please avoid using them at all costs.  They are more than happy to make a sale but much less so to help resolve any issues.

It's a stitch up on par with VW - rig the tests so you look good and screw everyone the rest of the time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

If you connect via RJ45 it regularly dips below 30mb or lower, you complain and it goes back up for a day or two then disappears. We have had 'faults' in our area as mentioned over a 4 week period all with different diagnoses, twice an engineer was promised and twice they didn't show as a 'general fault' had been experienced in the SE13 area.

3613,"I'm utterly fed up with virgin media, after cancelling my contract with them back in September I received a letter from them threatening to involve debt collectors and to effect my credit rating for a bill of Â£51.24 which was PAID on cancellation of the contract. This letter was received in DECEMBER. Months after cancellation. I checked my bank statements and this was confirmed to have gone through a few days after my call with them. The advisor I spoke to on the phone also confirmed to me that no more payments will be needed and that this was confirmed as cancelled. When I rang up today they stated this was not cancelled! This is ridiculous, they make it extremely impossible to cancel a contract and rob you of money. I have thus refused to pay and am waiting for confirmation this is cancelled. Another problem, the account name is different because when the contract was placed it was in store in the ipswich store. We were advised that the contract in a different name to the bill payer was FINE, this is making further delays for cancelling this stupid contract. I have now had to bother my friend numerous times asking for them to accept a call from virgin or to call virgin to cancel this officially. I am then told this time that there is some sort of ""probation order"" on cancelling an order and that I will receive a call back. It clearly seems that virgin cannot follow their own terms and conditions. Save yourselves the hassle do not bother with this company.",1.0

The deal got worse as you added all the things that Sky included and the broadband speed was nowhere near the advertised 200mbs After much messing about I have got the broadband upto about 100mps (where it limited by the modems) but only if you are with about 10 feet of the box move to the end of the room or upstairs and the speed drops off drastically.

If it does go down, four hours are usually the max one would have to wait for the engineers to have it running again. Oh yeah and since it's a multi node server (essentially it's own little big internet) they route around small problems while they are being fixed with people rarely noticing.So if they can do it so easily why can't virgin engineers do the same.Simple; the engineers are either not there (the person on the phone is lying; I'll call back to confirm after posting this), they are completely incompetent that they cannot locate the problem or they are working with equipment that is either above their ability or they were never trained to fix, hence being told that it will be fixed in 72h from our first call despite suffering problems for a week. You'd expect them to notice a small problem and fix it but they need to be told about it.Absolutely useless.Sorry if some of this is incomprehensible, I've been doing three things at once not including the review. Virgin media, it's about time you got on the ball and fixed these problems, rather than leaving us to sit and wait for days around the Christmas period.",1.0

3627,I feel I have been thoroughly taken for a ride my virgin. Everything was fine until I moved. It took a total of 9 phone calls for them to understand I live at number 1 and not number 2. I was then told by someone thousands of miles away that my house dosnt exist. They gave me a installation date but didn't change the address. I rang them and to change it from a number 2 to the correct number 1 my installation date was moved back 3 weeks. I was given another 2 installation dates and both times the technician never turned up. This cost me around Â£200 as I'm self employed. I dicided to leave virgin and get sky after that. I was told I owed them no money and they would send me packaging to return my virgin media equipment. 3 weeks later I had a letter from a debt recovery company saying I owed Â£230.01 ( may I add that the letter went to the wrong adress as virgin still hadn't bothered changing it. When I rang up to pay the bill through virgin miraculously my adress was changed straight away!!! I've never been so angry in all my life. When I rang virgin and asked what my lost revenue was worth after having 2 days off work waiting for Virgin to be installed I was given the cold shoulder and told to speak with the debt recovery company. So a word of advice. There products may work well but the companies customer services are undoubtedly the worst I have ever come across,2.0
3628,"As for the broadband itself it is fast BUT they throttle it so much that sometimes it's hardly worth having!   Mainly came here to warn of their customer service and underhand tactics though...  To all a warning. If you are thinking about reducing/increasing your services with Virgin be completely and 100% sure of what you are getting into as I have just been royally shafted and I WILL take them to court if it isn't corrected! On the 28th November at my request I had my services reduced right down to 50mb Broadband, Evenings and weekends phone and 'M' TV. A few days later on the 5th December I received a letter from Virgin with the terms of my new contract, wait... Contract???  This isn't what I asked for, I asked for a reduction in services not a new contract!!  So I rang them that evening and spoke to a gentleman on the phone who told me this is standard practice for any change in services. (Basically if you change your services you begin a new contract.)However, I did NOT ask for a new contract, I did NOT consent to a new contract and I was NOT informed I was entering into a new contract)So during this phone call to them I was informed of this and I explained to them that I never consented.  I said I wanted my services but I didn't want to be in a contract as I had only 'reduced' my services. The gentleman on the phone said I would need to speak to the contracts department which was open at different times (I had called late in the evening)Due to my job I was unable to call again until today where I spoke to a lady again about the problem. She was very nice and friendly (at first) and did everything she could to reduce the cost of my bill. Since I have moved to Sky for my TV and did NOT want to be in a contract with virgin I declined and that's when the fun started!The lady on the phone told me because I was still within the 14 days cancellation period (a mute point anyway since the contract is illegal) she could cancel my services HOWEVER I would be liable for the 30 days notice period!  What?? Is she for real? It's an illegal contract as I never consented to it!Again I argued my case and she said she would put me through to the contracts department.A few minutes later she came back on the phone and told me that she had spoken to them and they had informed her that since I was aware I was in a contract (because I had spoken to the gentleman on the 5th) that I was liable for the 30 days!!!I argued my case that whether I was aware of the contract or not I had still at no point consented to being in such contract and that their terms were void as a result!She had previously asked me why I didn't cancel my services on the 5th and I had told her that it was because I wanted to keep my services.  At this point she re-raised that part of the conversation and twisted my words stating that I had said I wanted to USE my services and that meant I was liable for the 30 days. She made a point in saying that all called are recorded and that's why she asked that question! She was being quite smarmy to be honest and I told her to put me through to the contracts department. She refused point blank to transfer me numerous times whilst telling me that SHE was my last port of call! Basically that I couldn't do anything about it and I had to pay the 30 days. I lost my temper and hung up!! Virgin entered me into a contract WITHOUT my permission, and then have shafted me into paying the 30 days cancellation period under the terms of the very contract I did NOT consent to!! Virgin, if this contract isn't voided I WILL take you to court as what you have done is against the law!! If someone would like to contact me to discuss the matter further then please do. Regards",2.0

So I called in October to cancel the direct debit and the advisor refunded me but the way the payments worked out each month I didn't require a refund so now I'm being charged for my bill and on top of that a Â£60 refund which I can not afford the advisor didnt offer a payment plan although I told him I'm out of work nor did I receive an apology throughout the entire conversation his language skills were so poor he sounded rude I find this with alot foreign customer service advisors. On this phone call he made me feel like a complete incompetent because I couldn't understand what was being said some of his words were: (youre not listening to me, why are you not understanding what I'm saying, your confusing yourself and making this difficult) these are not the words of a well trained and professional service advisor this is not the way you speak to a customer.

Clearly I had in fact been at my address and mobile phone to hand, no call, no door bell. Yodel the delivery company is not contactable after 1pm on Saturday and their online chat did nothing. I called Virgin Media, and having been put through to and explained the situation to 4 different people, all of whom were of the opinion I had missed the delivery and should consider waiting in for another day or I should collect and install the package from the depo myself.  Finally having complained to Yodel I realize Virgin gave them the incorrect address. So back to yet another network of calls with Virgin media, where I am told that the only way to correct the address is to cancel the account and start all over again. I am offered my first 2 month free, so think, ok one more shot! New appointment booked Friday the 27th Nov, my parents kindly agreeing to wait in for them. Nervous that there would be an issue and this time at the expense of my family, I called the day before to confirm the appointment, only to discover that the appointment had been made for the Saturday the 5th, and yet AGAIN on the wrong address. I ended up with one individual from Virgin Media on the land line telling me one thing, then a second Virgin Media person called me on a mobile and told me the opposite, at the point in which the Virgin Media staff member on the land line asks ME, to ask his colleague on the mobile line, to logout of my account, so that he can cancel it for the third time, I have finally lost all patients.

3668,"Paying for 100MB with TV and Phone. TL;DR, unreliable equipment, frequent engineer visits, incorrectly processed original order and nowhere near the promised speeds. Engineer came out and installed, all seemed fine. Two days later we were getting sub 1MB a lot of the time. Engineer comes out again, new router. We joined in July, have had 3 engineer visits (not including installation). the superhub was replaced in less than a month from installation, and we still have to reboot the damned thing twice a week. Our old router was about as simple as you could as for - no WPS, didn't support encryption higher than WEP, but if we rebooted it twice in a year it was notable. When we ordered, we upgraded to the larger TiVo box. Got an order confirmation with the upgrade on it. About a month after the installation, we noticed that it was filling up VERY fast. Took at look, but nowhere on the box or in the settings does it actually tell you the drive size. Called them up, they didn't know how to tell either, so I asked them how much the 1TB version should be able to record and established that mine only had half that capacity. They apparently checked my order and told me that there was no upgrade on it. I had the confirmation email in front of me, but I was wrong. I then had to get another one sent out, send the old one back (so I lost all the stuff I had series linked in the old box) and they were going ""well, we'll charge you Â£50 for the upgrade"" and telling me they hadn't billed me the Â£50 on the original order. I made it very clear to them that if they did charge me both I'd be taking it further. The real aggravation however is the speed. We changed from talktalk because we were paying for 20 and getting 6-8 (so 30-40% return, probably because of old hardware). Right now I'm paying for 100MB and its rare that it goes over 50MB. I'm pragmatic, I know that 100 doesn't mean 100, but I was expecting ~70MB from them with all the new hardware. I've started a folder that's just screenshots of the speedtests, showing how bad they are. Engineers come out, go ""no, its showing me 100MB on this speedtest, I know you've got 15 screenshots from the last 2 weeks where its below 20, but I can't reproduce it so bye"". We only changed this year.

Their forum simply spouts ticket numbers out of their face, none of which come up with a resolution, and most recently, I saw someone, in response to somebody complaining about 'poor ping response times and throttled download speed', that 'everything was fine their end'.

I thought I may be due an upgrade. Having listened to what I said the chap then told me what I could pay to upgrade to and I noted that I'd be better off leaving them and then coming back on board as a new customer. He didn't pay any attention to what I was saying really and was just mired in his sales patter. Essentially I got nothing out of him in terms of upgrade, service or sense.On the phone they are just as bad. I have waited in all day for an engineer to show up and fix my phone land-line (essential as their mobile coverage is so bad).

It was tweaked to 30 mbps and still all good and more than adequate for Apple tv and any other computing items and coping well with HD downloads. Early this year Virgin again tweaked the broadband to 50 mbps needles to say to compete with the now upcoming BT and sky 38 mb services and I thought brilliant another tweak in speed and with greater use of Internet tv services and interest in 4k tv through Netflix I was over the moon, sadly it wasn't to be as I started to notice that my broadband wasn't anywhere near doing what it should. I ran tests and found that I was pulling between 0.25-3.5 mbps and this was consistent daily. I reset the router and even changed the frequency as advised buy Virgin and no joy. I left it for a while and thought perhaps it's one of those things but the speed just seemed to get worse so I contacted Virgin media direct... At first they told me there were no issue in the area but after pressing matters they admitted the road needed digging up and they were awaiting permission from the council to do the upgrade then they gave me a Â£7 reduction which I had to contact them every month to apply to the account and for there problem which they kept under wraps. Even more frustrating were there price hikes.. You get a discount for the issue then within weeks you get an e mail saying something was going up. I have since tried to contact them only to be cut off after waiting on numerous occasions and other issue I had were when my wife left I wad in personal hell and because I was a week late on payment and despite me phoning them they happily slapped a late payment fee and cut me off for a whole 2 days even though I had never had payment issues ever in the past either. I have now had to go down the rout of e mail complaints and filling in online forms which generally I get a sorry and no action taken. Virgin treat there customers in a poor way and as soon as I can I am leaving, if anyone reads this thinking of moving to them then I ask you to go online and check the daily comments on there site on face book and every day you see the same with people paying top dollar fir there 150 mbps service and pulling about 1% of that.

3757,"I felt that I wanted to have something in writing as I'm really disheartened by the customer service I have received in recent weeks and I have been advised over the phone that you do not accept complaints in writing.On 25th July I called to enquire about changing my Big Kahuna package as I was unhappy with the second price rise in 6 months and felt that it was becoming expensive. Both myself and my husband (who works in IT) spoke with the representative and she was advising us of technical information which was incorrect. I felt she was bamboozling me with figures and was argumentative with my husband when he queried the technical information although he knows he is correct as that is his job. After the call we decided that we wanted to leave Virgin Media as we were unhappy with the price rises and the attitude of the member of staff.Later that day I called back to request a cancellation of my contract and I asked for the final date which was confirmed as 13th August. From this I believed the contract would end on 12th September and waited for packaging to be sent to collect the boxes. I was not informed until today that the person I spoke to is not authorised to process disconnections and the only notes put on the system were to say I have requested information about cancelling. I know this to be incorrect as I requested the information during the first call, therefore it is illogical that I would request the same information twice in one day. I am extremely angry that I was not told during that call that I was speaking to the wrong person as I had gone through the automated system to the cancellations department.At this point as far as I was concerned everything was going ahead with the cancellation. We arranged to have replacement services through Sky which were all installed in mid August. Therefore, all Virgin Media services have been unused since mid August. I accepted that there would be some crossover of services and I would need to pay for both contracts for approximately 1 month.I was therefore very surprised to receive a full bill last Wednesday, covering up to 7th October. On Thursday I called to query the bill and was put through to customer relations. I explained the situation and was advised that the notes did not state that I had requested a cancellation which is why the bill had been produced. After a lengthy conversation explaining everything your representative said she could see that the services had been unused since mid August and agreed with me that it was illogical that I would make two calls in the same afternoon requesting the same information. At my request, after discussions with her manager, it was agreed that someone would listen to the recording of the call to verify my story and someone would call me back no later than Friday. I was happy with this situation as I knew I had requested the cancellation and the representative said that if my version of events was confirmed then the cancellation would be back dated to 25th July so the final date would be 24th August. If my version was proved incorrect the notice would be given from 3rd September.As I had not received a call up to today I decided to chase this up and call in again. I was told today that the notes do not state I requested a cancellation (which I already knew) and therefore it had not been processed. I explained I was enquiring about the recording as discussed on Thursday to be told that the call will not be listened to as calls are not recorded for dispute resolution. I was also told that the second person I spoke to on 25th July is not authorised to cancel contracts, as far as I am concerned that should have been explained at the time not 6 weeks later. I explained that I was very upset and frustrated about the lack of consistency with what I have been told. The representative said there was nothing they could do except backdate the cancellation request to Thursday meaning I have to pay for services up to 2nd October even though I was expecting the contract to end on 12th September, meaning I have to pay for an extra 3 weeks.Perhaps I was naive in not recording the calls myself but as a loyal customer of nearly 6 years I feel very let down. I have been made to feel that I am lying, because I can't prove the outcome of the calls made on 25th July I am to suffer financially. I made the second call on 25th July in good faith and I feel it is not in any way my fault that the person didn't inform me that they could not help me with the cancellation and either put me through to someone who could help or advise me to call back. The person I spoke to on Thursday I felt genuinely wanted to help and I was informed today she will get in trouble for trying to help by offering to have the call listened to (which was supported by her manager). I also find it baffling that you will not accept complaints in writing. I feel this has been a catelogue of poor and inconsistent customer service, with no regard for the fact the customer may be right. Simply because the notes state I did not request a cancellation there will be no investigation to check that I'm telling the truth. As I informed your representative today I will be writing to Ofcom and I will never consider being a Virgin Media customer in the future. As someone who has spent in excess of Â£800 a year on services for the past 5+ years would it have been so terrible to take me at my word and refund me the Â£62.50 to backdate the cancellation?",2.0

We were told that they would come between 1 and 6pm. By 6.00 they hadn't arrived and we did not receive a phone call to explain where the engineer was or what was going on. I was told by Virgin Media at 5.50 that the engineer had stated in his system that 'he was on his way'. I asked her where he was coming from and how long he would be.She couldn't say because she didn't know. At 6.30 I rang AGAIN!. This time I asked to speak with a manager.The woman told me to explain the complaint and then she would put a mangaer on. After I told her that the engineer hadnt turned up, she tried to fob me off with....'Oh we usually tell our customers that sometimes they may run a little late'. The time was now 6.30pm and at 5.50pm I was told that he was on his way. At 7.00pm, the engineer still hadn't arrived. I rang for the third time and asked to speak with a manager. Someone called Johnathan claiming to be a manager told me that he couldnt locate him (CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!) A worker couldnt be located. Ive nver heard of such nonsense before. They couldnt contact him but'He was held up in a job!'That is not what I was told before. Now this Johnathan was telling me that he was down to still come.

We have been having problems with our broadband for a few days, which affects so much of what we do.

Trying to re-book an engineer took more than one hour on the telephone, to a call centre in India where English is far from a first language.

3814,I would never recommend anyone to use virgin business. I agreed to move fro BT to virgin because there was no superfast broadband yet in my area apart from virgin. So signed up for phone line and 152mb broadband.

So told them to cancell everything. They are totally incompetent and organised. Dont touch them,2.0
3815,"Good points:- The set up process was simple.- Customer service of installation staff was brilliant.- Internet speeds were great (when internet was working). Could stream movies etc. on two devices at once with no problem.- Online account useful to check bills/payments etc. Bad points:- Internet would cut off sometimes, and on occasion not reconnect for an entire day, even when Hub is restarted.- Price increased by too much within the contract period. And was already a bit expensive in my opinion for the service being provided.- Customer service I received over the phone was terrible. I couldn't understand the advisor (as his English was poor), and he couldn't understand my accent either. This made what should be a simple process of ending the contract unnecessarily complicated. Cannot comment on parental controls as did not use them but they are offered. Overall the broadband itself was great (speedwise) but at times unreliable, and customer service over the phone was awful.",2.0

For a house full of students who have mountains of research to do each day, ensuring the broadband is working is at the back of our minds.

3843,"Iâve been with Virgin Media for almost five years now with an average spend of around Â£50 per month in that time. That works out to around Â£3000 that Iâve spent on a service that has continually let me down. So you might be asking why am I still with them? Well initially, my company was paying for the Virgin Media service so when they first started letting me down with crackling on the phone line, I wasnât really that bothered. It meant I didnât have to speak to my colleagues as often! It took them about a year to solve the issue and everything was OK until recently again. At the start of the year 2015, I noticed the router would occasionally disconnect from the network and struggle to reconnect. Having called out the engineers several times and given one excuse after another, I am still having the issue 6 months on. Itâs been getting worse over the past month. I called them today when my router was down, and during my conversation with a very hostile customer service lady, it came back on and she said there was nothing she could do now because everything was up and running again. I explained that this was an intermittent problem, but she really couldnât care less. Now Iâm having to decide to sacrifice speed for reliability by signing up to another provider. The last engineer that came out was a nice man who explained that there was an issue with the line running from my property to the main box in the street. He said the cable would need changing so he booked this in for me. Funnily enough, which I suspect is down to the cost, he called me a day later to say that a network engineer had resolved the issue and the line would not need changing so he cancelled the job. My suspicions are that he got a rollicking from his superiors by even mentioning that option to me. It appears Virgin Media do not care about long standing customers. And why would they. Iâve given them so much cash, they couldnât care less. The intermittent problem aside, when my up to 100Mb line was working fine, it would often slow down considerably at peek times, so I could be watching Netflix in HD for it only to slow down and buffer. Yes they offer a very fast connection speed relative to the other providers but their customer service and dedication to resolving customer issues is really poor.

3858,"We've been a customer of Virgin Media for well about 8 years after NTL went bust... And what a hair ripping 8 years it has been. Before I start, I'm going to say that this review will be based more on the morals and attitudes of Virgin, rather than their broadband service.  Firstly, all they care about is your money as a customer, rather than you as an individual. This is my biggest gripe with Virgin. Currently, we're paying Â£48.99 a month for 20 Megabit broadband and anytime phone. Absurd. The reason that we're still paying it is because no other ISP could before this time offer us faster broadband speeds, and we couldn't afford any slower Internet. So, we asked them how much it would cost to upgrade to 60Mb fibre; they said Â£20 EXTRA a month... So that's Â£68.99 a month they want for 60Mb fibre and anytime phone. Yet, a new customer can get all that PLUS TV for Â£20 a month less.  If you're a new customer to Virgin or thinking of moving, you'll have a great first year or for however long your contract is. But as soon as you're no longer new, they're gonna kick you in the wallet and with the service they provide.  The reliability of our Internet is insane, I would say we probably have about 60% uptime... Constantly resetting modems and routers as we're still using the NTL modem and a Netgear router, as they wanted even more money to replace them with Virgin's modem/router.  Their morals are based around getting as much money out of you as possible, with providing as little service as they can. Ever wondered why Virgin is one of the most profitable companies in the world, and why Mr. Branson has his own island? Well now you know, it all comes from your wallet.  Can say with huge relief that not two days ago BT posted a letter through our door saying they can finally offer us Infinity. Was on the phone immediately and made the switch. Don't expect to stick with Virgin for very long, the second your contract is over they'll have new offers for new customers and all current or old customers will be thrown to the back of the priority list.",2.0

Sorry Virgin Media, but you can stuff that offer where the sun don't shine! What an insult for having to put up with your lack of service. Something else you should know. They have no idea when their service has gone down. The only way they can monitor this, is if enough people in your local area ring them to complain about loss of service. Call centre is in India (or similar) and they are dire. If you are one of the first to ring in, when the local service has gone down again, they treat it as if it's just you who has a problem and normally try and convince you that it's your computer that's at fault.

They can't be bothered to look for the payment, it's just easier for them to collect it from their customer for the second time. I'll tell you what's really unfair, when they disconnect you & you haven't even been sent a bill. This has happened to us 3 times. And this is really scary when you have elderly parents, that need to speak to a doctor. They say that you can call emergency numbers, but actually you can't call your doctor in an emergency. They've sent us reminder bills instead of the actual bill & within the first week. This I think has happened about 4 times. When we had internet, my speeds were soo slow. Extremely slow. I was hacked in to. I could not get rid of whoever was on the line & then I signed up with one of their services in order to have their specialists clean up my computer over the internet.

To their credit they did compensate me for the issues I had, but had I know that these issues were to continue I would have signed up with another provider.

Being told to ""check back in a week or so"" really doesn't cut it. The fact they seem incapable of resolving the issue is worrying. If my company took this long to resolve a fault somebody would be out of a job. Rather than offers of credits on my bill, I'd rather just have a service that works. Virgin Media is out of touch with what really matters to customers and I think they will find that despite offering cash bribes to keep customers placated, many (including me) will start moving to alternative service providers. I no longer have any confidence in Virgin as a service provider.

Essentially, I am wasting my money as the majority of the time I'm using my 3G in my own house to get internet. The service is down far too often, as I'm a student this is fairly critical. For example this morning I couldn't submit my essay as the service was down again, and had to save to a pen drive, drive to a friends and use their internet. Absolutely ridiculous. This happens all the time, and I've spoken to customer services on far too many occasions now. The calls cost a fortune, and the best outcome I've ever has was when I was offered one pound compensation. An absolute joke. I will be switching to someone else ASAP, I have never been offered an explanation why the service is apparently down so often in my area, and rarely do they care to help me or offer anything to assist me. Poor show Virgin, thoroughly disappointed considering it is the most expensive internet I've ever paid for.",2.0

3924,"Broadband has a good speedy connection, but the modem broke down only after 2 months of installing it and a man had to come out to replace it. This was  annoying but it was fine as it was dealt with within a week. But then regrettably, I had to leave my flat. This meant I had  to terminate my contract with Virgin Media after 5 1/2 months which I knew was going to be a problem as I had a contract with Virgin Media for 18 months. When I called customer service, the lady who I spoke to said that there was no way I could terminate the contract and I would have to pay the whole price of the contract regardless, or  alternatively I could move it to a new address. I was a bit shocked that there was absolutely nothing they could do for me, and I had no one that would need a new internet installation. I felt helpless and the next day I called back again to see if I could speak to someone new who could help me. The man I spoke to was much more reasonable and said I could take out a contract with virgin mobile for 2 months and this will allow me to exit my last contract. The man reassured me that the mobile hotspot will be automatically cancelled after 2 months and there was no need to call back again. After 4 months I was still being charged and as I was so busy with work, I didn't even realise. I called Virgin this weekend to tell them about it. I told my story to three different people at customer service, and each person was unsure of why I had been made to transfer contracts from Virgin Media to Virgin Mobile as they are different departments. Each person had never heard of any offer been made b they tried before and were unsure of how to help me. Additionally, each time these people from customer service tried to transfer me through to someone who could assist me - I was disconnected each time. This was really frustrating as I was unable to settle this without speaking to a telephone customer advisor. By the fourth time of calling them back I was becoming impatient and I demanded to be told of the names of people who I was currently connected to. However, this request was positively rejected as it was not their personal wish to do so. When I was finally transferred to the Mobile department without being rejected, I was told by the advisor that money had been taken out of my account accidentally and they were sorry for this. They mentioned how they were unsure of why I had been placed on a new contract with Virgin Mobile, as it was nothing to do with the previous Virgin Media contract. As I had not even used the Mobile hotspot, and I only took this contract because I was told to, I then asked if I would be refunded for this - to which I was placed on hold for another 20 minutes. The customer advisor returned and said, no, but we won't charge you anymore. I couldn't be bothered to argue because it's been a load of unneccesary stress that I don't need. But I just can't believe how abusive Virgin can be. If I was a vulnerable person, they would have me over a barrel, and I am just absolutely disgusted with their customer service.",2.0
3925,"I'd like to know why as a long standing loyal and overcharged customer, it's going to cost me a lot more to upgrade from my outdated box with a shocking performing router to TiVo, than the price new customers can get. Maybe my call to Virgin Media should have been a demand to replace the shoddy Netgear router than to offer them an extended contract.

Broadband had been fine for a while, after intermittent problems some time ago, but today it starting acting up again - kept dropping, rebooted modem and got it back, then it dropped again, over and over all day. So I rang them this evening to try to get the problem fixed and was told that it was due to ""very high usage"" in my postcode area (too many people using too little bandwidth after their recent sales push), that the engineers were working on upgrading the equipment and THIS SITUATION WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL SOMETIME IN JULY!!!!!!!  So, I am faced with dreadful intermittent, slow broadband for the next 3 months or so?!?!?! This is NOT GOOD ENOUGH! You sell like mad, run out of capacity, do an upgrade (during which we suffer poor service) and then you sell like mad and we go round the cycle yet again. As far as I am concerned this is breach of contract and, unless this is resolved I shall be looking to cancel my contract with Virgin and move to another provider - probably BT or Sky. It will be slower (no Affinity here yet) but hopefully it will be more stable. Shame on you, Virgin.

When I ring Virgin up (and after being passed to 4 different people) I'm told that I can't have that email now I'm a Virgin Media Cable customer.

This however only tells half the story.Virgin's customer service is fantastic. They have rewarded loyalty with making sure that my package is always cheaper than for new customers.

When I asked about further upgrades they told me that I could be upgraded to 152mb and still have my loyalty deal.

3975,"Primarily signed up with virgin for gaming (which against popular belief only requires a STABLE 4-5mb connection). Virgin is great at 2am when I register 34mb speeds, and a ping well below 20. My computer is new, and hard wired.  But I don't really need useful internet at 2am, I expected and pay money to get useful internet during the day and evenings. After 6pm until midnight, most nights, I've observed my speeds dropping to 2-4mb. The ping results are even worse ranging from 150 to 999. This isn't a slight drop in service that's reasonably expected, this is a failure of service. I can't game at night. A 1000% drop in download speed is completely useless to me. When I ping test, I receive a level of service to various UK severs far slower than someone in New Zealand or California. I'd love to ask virgin, why is my internet in accessing a uk server slower than someone on the other side of the world? This quality of service is a complete joke. Virgin broadband, as well as useless to me at night, is not reliable or stable. How they can produce adverts implying they provide internet that is usable for a whole family? Including myself there are 2 people in the household I live. I only have one device that uses internet, my hardwired PC. How virgin have not been sued for misrepresenting claims of service I don't know. At best there claims are misleading, at worst they deliberately lie about what it is they offer.

If ever you are choosing broadband, do not choose Virgin Media with their low prices, as you will surely get shitty connection which will disappear every day around 7 in the evening.

I looked at other providers for better deals and I wanted tv in the new package. I was going to move with talktalk because it's cheaper and then 2 days later... Virgin moved me to talktalk randomly. No deals or anything because I was technically a virgin customer still. I started experiencing this stupid home safe on every website I tried to get on. Customer service for virgin is ridiculous, 1) I kept telling them it's not my router as I can access the internet but they kept sayings it's the router, well duh I don't work there but it's not rocket science. 2) no-one speaks fluent English, I'm asian so don't say I'm racist. 3) they said I need to speak with talktalk, adds another Â£20 to my bill, thanks for that. 4) promises saying they'll note it down, but we all know what happens, it goes in the bin or doesn't get noted at all. I had enough so I moved to talktalk. I actually got a fluent English speaker and his name was Ben! Very helpful and I'm waiting for them to move me over. They can offer me tv also! For the same price as I am paying... Actually cheaper. Get off virgin, it's a scam provider and hopefully watchdogs will get them because they are ridiculous.

Which I needed to have disconnected from the property so the new tennants could set up their own.  After five or so minutes of the man taking all of my details then said we can transfer it to your new address. Which in return I explained once again that cannot be done as we don't have a permanent address. I asked if the contract could be paused while I find my partner and myself somewhere to live and then we could continue where we left off. Which was a no. The only option I had was to pay them a rediculios amount of money and terminate the account as we were only half way through the contracted period. After ten more minutes of this going back and forth he said he could give us a month and then it could be transferred over. Great. That was what I wanted in the first place. He then in his mumbled his way through some disconnection confirmations then proceeded to try and get me to refer someone for Virgin media and then started going on about virgins phone deals. No idea why but hey. I was happy I didn't have to pay a hefty bill and got to keep my broadband for my next home when I found one. I was then plonked on hold for a while as he 'calculated' something. As he was so quiet I barely managed to understand what he meant. He came back and gave me yet another bill amount and told me they do not offer the service of freezing or holding the account which he said earlier was fine. Being completely confused as to what he has done I asked to speak to someone else as he was now just repeating the same phrases from earlier in the same order. He refused and said everything is done now. I ended up hanging up the phone as he was increasingly becoming louder and getting ruder as I was asking him what he as actually done with my account.  I rang the customer service team to get some answers. I spoke to a lovely woman who brought up my account and found that the account was to be closed with a exit fee to be taken from my account. She put me through to the move and transfer team to see if my broadband can be taken to my temporary address so I do not have to pay the exit fee and get to keep my broadband. I wasn't even given this option from the first man. But predictably my temporary address does not have fibre optic so that went out the window. So I'm now left with a lovely bill but now if I love into a virgin area I can call them and resetup the account and get my money back. But if I don't move into a virgin area I'm basically porked. I really liked the broadband's realiability even if I never managed to get close to the download speeds I was supposed to have, even if I plugged my computer into the hub.

4034,"I am not a customer. But I am trying .... It seems that I need to do more. I filled in the online purchase, I agreed to pay up front, I agreed the install date and all the T&C's and sat back waiting for delivery. What a fool! I should have known that the install and delivery dates quoted on Virgin's own website are fictitious, utterly fabricated lies. So sad that I'd already arranged to fly back from abroad to meet this fictitious date. An utterly wasted expense that Virgin doesn't care about. All because I had to pass a credit check, this was news to me. Remember I'd agreed to pay the whole contract up front ... I don't want or need any credit. And I don't have a mortgage or borrowing to 'score' me on. But that didn't matter, the Virgin stupidity continued to an obvious conclusion - I didn't need credit but If I did I was good for it and therefore passed the credit check after a few days.  But those few days were enough to ensure that my trip back to UK to meet an engineer, any engineer, were wasted. They couldn't send an engineer until I am out of the country again - how unhelpful. So I wondered; I asked, because they did not, ""do I actually need an engineer ? Can I just get a router and plug it in?"" Yes came the reply that's what the engineer would do. I pointed out the obvious that as I am a sentient being not a cabbage I am also able to plug in a router - could they just send one to me. Why yes? Of course. We'll send one Thursday.  Well I couldn't be there Thursday, but my wife could and happily she is a sentient being too. It was arranged, Thursday, not before, delivered to my wife at her central London 8 storey building. Oh but guess what, you'll never guess ... it didn't turn up. The courier reported at 12.30pm that he couldn't get a reply? Interesting this is a building with 3 permanent receptionists - all briefed to accept this particular delivery. I suggest he did not go to the right address. So what did Virgin do? nothing of course. Not 'til I chased at 4.30pm did we find out that the courier could be bothered to find the correct landmark building in a central London street. Virgin have no alartm or alert that deliveries had failed - pretty poor really.  I called the courier to be told the same garbage about no-one being there and then to be told of the impossibility that they (a courier) could deliver a package that day/evening to the correct address which was 4 miles from their depot. I assumed they they had vehicles, maybe I am wrong. Maybe Yodel (the courier) relies upon elderly gentlemen carrying heavy sacks to transport their deliveries, in which case I can see that a 4 mile journey might be hard to complete in 2 hours. Never the less I was told the 'driver' (of what?) had gone home at 4.30pm and the delivery might happen the next day. Now you might think I was dismayed or even angry at this point. You'd be right. Angry that I ever bother call Virgin at all. But clutching at straws I called Virgin yet again. After voicing my discontent I was bounced around a few operatives before being told that the delivery had failed - really, I had told them that 4 times at that point! And that it 'should' take place the next day. I pointed out that this was not acceptable and was told nothing else could be done. But that's not true, because I could readily imagine what could be done and thus I asked why a reliable and competent courier (of which there are dozens in London), one who has vehicles and competent staff, could not be dispatched to collect the package from the incompetent and aging hands of the old sack dragging deliveryman at Yodel and whisked the 4 miles to my wife. All of this could be done, but not by Virgin. They best that could be done was to make sure that it would be delivered tomorrow. Apparently they ONLY use Yodel or the Post, no other couriers ever!  Now, I find that surprising, because I doubt that Richard Bransonï»¿ could have built his brilliant business empire if he was encumbered by a total inability to deliver anything on time. So I asked if this service is not good enough for Richard Branson, why should be good enough for me ... a Customer ? But then I remembered - I am not a customer. I am just trying to be customer !! PS: 24 hours later the old man dragging a sack has finally arrived, but at the wrong address! My wife isn't where she was yesterday. I'd alerted them and updated the address to Virgin and Yodel, but the old sack man must have been in transit already and arrived a day late at the wrong place. So that makes it a 100% success rate for Virgin - EVERYTHING they have told me they'll do is wrong. I wonder if their service even works - god knows. And we can't find out until our carrier has transported the Router to the right address, at our expense of course!",2.0

Still not got it back to BT yet though hopefully this will happen now that I have a second MAC code. Absolutely no consideration given to their customers. I am appalled by their behaviour. At least 3 months notice should have given to allow customers to transfer their accounts, web space and email to an ISP of their choice in an organised way. Only then and after clear notification offer the 'hassle free' transfer to TalkTalk. Hassle free is a bit of a joke as many customers including myself found that with TalkTalk the email immediately stopped working as the settings in our email client needed to be changed and as stated previously web addresses and email addresses will ultimately be lost.",2.0

And they need to give 2 weeksâ notice to the Council. Which I guess they did, as I had to wait over 2 weeks for my engineer appointment. Of course, the engineer never turned up, but I suppose I should thank Virgin for the minimal effort they made to contact me, just the day before the engineer visit was due, to inform me that he now wonât be coming for another 4 weeks. Which means Iâll have been without any service for a total of 6 weeks. Why is it going to take 4 weeks now?

Secondly, we pay for 152mbps, but you could count on one hand the number of times we have even approached this. The combination of poor wi-fi signal, and low speeds mean it's not unusual to get speeds below 5, or sometimes even 1, mbps in the bedrooms. Thirdly, it regularly stops working totally. It's extremely rare for a day to pass where it doesn't drop out, with drop outs lasting anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple of hours. We have to turn the router on and off again a couple of times, most days.

I called Virgin Media, they ran several tests which proved unsuccessful as they blamed the insulation in the wall which is completely untrue. So then the next blame went to somebody in area installing other devices which is interfering with mine and therefore there is nothing they can do. They were also happy with me getting less than 1mb wireless internet as they said I am not paying for wireless, I am paying only for the wired connection and wireless is an added bonus with no connection speed guarantees which means even if your wireless speed is 0, that is considered satisfactory for them. I would have thought a broadband company would at least aim to provide basic wireless speed to just browse internet or watch few videos, but that isn't the case with them. Furthermore, they recommended I should buy another Router that is more powerful as the one they provide is not satisfactory for providing the relevant wireless speeds needed.

4085,"I've got to say Virgin, you guys are absolute con artists with deceiving selling tactics and who clearly want to squeeze every penny out of every service you provide. My parents had been loyal Sky customers for years (9 in fact) and mistakenly thought that loyalty paid dividends. Which most savvy consumers know, when you arenât getting what you paid for, you go to an alternative provider who can offer you better for either the same price or preferably cheaper. When Sky broadband wasnât providing the service they were paying, i looked into a better alternative for them. Virgin, as it happened, at been inundating them via the post for some time to try and sway their hand, My step father who was dubious to change as they enjoyed all the comforts of Sky TV and the calls to Australia (where myself and fiancÃ©e live) which Sky offered at a good rate, wanted to see whether Virgin could offer them something. My parents had the full package with Sky - TV/Broadband/Phone etc and although it was the broadband they were mainly unhappy with, listened to what Virgin had to offer. For a few weeks, telephone calls went back and forth with Virgin, the sales advisor very keen to get my parents on aboard and eventually agreed to match what my parents were paying at Sky and promised that EVERYTHING my parents had with Sky, they would get with Virgin (apart from Sky Atlantic but that was fine) As they were changing for fibre-optic, they thought this was a good deal to change over from Sky so decided to give it a try, bearing in mind my parents are very old school and hate chopping and changing. Fast forward to this week. They had a friendly Virgin chap come round and set everything all up for them in a few hours and my parents seemed fairly pleased with the easy transition. That was, however, until they decided to watch TV and noticed they werenât able to access the Sky Sports and Movie HD channels which they of course found strange as they were promised by the Virgin Sales Advisor that my parents would get EVERYTHING that they had with Sky. Needless to say, my parents rang Virgin to query this and would you believe the audacity of the person on the phone who said that my parents would have to pay an extra Â£7 per month for the Sky movies and sport HD Channels(!!!) Of course, my step father who had to be convinced to change in the first place was both shocked and angry at this. The unsympathetic cancellations advisor or whatever they wish to call themselves, in a very patronising manner said that 'on this occasion, we will waiver the extra Â£7 per month for 12 months' as if this was a gesture of good will even though my step father thoroughly explained he had been mis-sold the package. My parents eventually got what was promised and were able to get the HD channels. The next day, my parents noticed that when they were getting incoming calls the caller ID was coming up as 'External Caller' which they have never seen before so decided to call Virgin again to find out whether this was their doing as they couldnât see the number or their phone, guess what? Virgin said 'To have that facility you need to pay an extra Â£2.25 per month'! Now, you could be reading this thinking, its only Â£7 and Â£2.25 but when you put that on top of what you are already paying and when you have completely changed everything from another provider on the promise and guarantee that everything would stay the same, you feel conned and mis-sold. Virgin, your selling tactics and customer service come under real scrutiny with this and because of this, you have lost what would potentially be a loyal customer (providing you gave the service which was promised) now as they are in their 14 day cooling off period, i am now helping them look for another provider. Thank you for teaching us a hard lesson that dont expect to receive what you are promised, will be delivered. Note to all potential Virgin customers. Make sure you know what you are paying for, even though they promise to 'Match' whatever you were paying before.

4097,"After a visit from a friendly salesman in March this year, I signed up to Virgin broadband as one of my lodgers, who paid for a Sky package, moved and took it with him. It was set up quickly and worked perfectly until June when the signal became intermittent. By July it packed up completely. I tried calling to rectify the problem but could never get through. E-mails were left unanswered and I wrote instead. In the meantime, I also had problems paying the bills. They only offered on-line payments but failed to give me the passwords and special pin numbers to access and pay the bill. The bill e-mails also arrived on the day the bill was due therefore my delayed payment (by cheque) included a late payment charge. I wrote two more times to complain about both problems but still no reply. My third letter resulted in an automated letter confirming receipt of my complaint letters but nothing else happened.  Not long after the broadband failed, the box overheated to the point where it was too hot to touch and smelled of burning plastic. I unplugged it as soon as I noticed it. (I had to hide the router outside as one of my silly clown lodgers, fed up with no internet, kept plugging it back in despite the danger!) Once again I wrote to Virgin with now three complaints - plus a threat to request cancellation but still no reply. At the end of July I wrote one final time to say I was cancelling my subscription and would only pay the final bill for July plus a month's notice, for August, which I duly paid. Late August I finally received a letter from Virgin Media Customer Complaints Department. The gentleman made various claims and excuses and even contradicted himself a few times. He basically said I had to telephone to cancel the service but because I was still under contract, a Â£180 fee plus an extra month's bill had to be paid. H even said they had no record of me reporting any faults. I wrote back pointing out these issues and my refusal to pay the fee as they breached the agreement by not providing me with any service. I also pointed out that I had requested to cancel in writing and was not comfortable handing over sensitive information over the phone.  He wrote back again urging me to call but I refused. By now I received another bill (this time by post because I ignored the e-mail bill) for September which I did not pay. He said I still had to pay the Â£195 cancellation fee (it increased!) really pushed the need to phone him during office hours. I work during the day making this impossible. He also said they had a record of me calling Virgin in June about the billing problem but had never reported the fault.  Disgusted by such ignorance, I waited before writing back. I received another bill (by post) for October's outstanding bill plus another letter from Customer Care issuing a Default Notice. I was given 14 days to reply. I have sought some legal advice and written to the gentlemen in both departments standing firm to what I already said. Now I think it is just a battle of the wills. Is it worth taking me to court for Â£91 outstanding? What happened to the Â£195 fee?  By this stage, the phone calls started. I had one missed call each day for a week. I looked it up and saw it was Virgin. I saved it in my mobile as 'DoNotAnswerVirgin1'. I also received a daily text message asking me to call them. Over the last two weeks I have had three calls a day, between 8:20 and 19:00 from three different numbers (all saved the same as above but with a '2' and a '3' at the end) plus one text message per day. I duly ignore them. My advice is NOT to make (or receive) phone calls but put everything in writing. This way you retain a hard copy of all correspondence. Phone calls are time-consuming, expensive and are recorded to be used against you. All other companies expect contracts to be made out in writing including the cancellation of such agreements. Virgin prefer to get you on the phone, twist your words and delay cancellation so that they can extract more money.  It makes that creepy, grinning goatee beard seem all the more sinister.

Once this device period was up, and we'd all moves out however, the next months of food money had been taken from my bank, and they were still billing me. After querying this via their online email form (as there is no way you can actually email someone specific and their phone lines are always full of people complaining, or closed), the explanation I received by what I can only described as a barely readable and and lazy reply was that I was now on a rolling contact became I did not call them to 'cancel' by services. My contact states a minimum service period of 9 months, and no where did I agree to any longer when I made an account online. I was not aware you had to give notice to 'cancel' and contact that was supposed to run out anyway! I replied to them with this, and was ignored.I felt I wasn't valued as a customer, that I was being exploited as a 'young naive student', and now they are hassling me for bills issued from when I wasn't even resident at the property.

Elderly and disabled people should not have to go through this, but nobody should.   A contract is just that.  an agreement between two parties.   When that contract is broken, that is an end, but not with Virgin Media.  Before I join any company I want to KNOW what I am signing for, but Virgin media  are not at all happy about sending out a copy of the contract first.   They prefer 'verbal'  phone contracts and then the difficulty is getting the service you have required.  Either with connection faults, or broadband speeds. They provide what is termed an 'up to' broadband speed like all other suppliers.  But if you are only getting 60% of that speed will they allow you to pay only 60% of the bill? Yes, eventually  they might send one of THEIR employees to check to see if a fault is found and then tell you there isn't.  Then you are liable to their extortionate charges. How convenient. Occasionally you may get a genuinely helpful person at virgin media who will do all they can to help, but this is the exception rather than the rule as the remainder of the staff are either inept of just plain not interested because once they have your money, that is it.   Where is OFCOM in all of this?  As far as I can see it is yet another government organisation which has been set up to divert away the attention of the customer into thinking something is going to be done to protect them when all OFCOM is there for is to gather information but they do NOT deal with independent complaints so they are totally ineffective.   When VM first started the service was far better, but with overseas call centres, staff who really do not care ( and if they cannot answer your questions they cut you off) and the goal of trying to screw every penny they can, this is one company to avoid like the plague.     .",2.0

Within the call centre I have been told conflicting information time and time again and it boils down to the fact that as a company they are completely incompetent.  The man I work with has obvious learning needs, he was sold a product via a door to door sales man which was Â£7 for 6 months and then Â£14 per month thereafter (18 month contact). The issues I have are 1) the man in question isn't capable of attending a doctor's appointment alone, so how they can think he is able to commit to paying for Virgin Media is beyond me...2) the month virgin was installed he was arrested held in custody.  He was incarcerated for 6 months (he has mental health issues) at the time virgin were contacted and told that he would be unable to pay. At this point they took his box and the service with them ended. From this moment onwards,  virgin have pursued him for just short of Â£70. This amount is small, but he has no money and is unable to pay, Furthermore,  he should never have been sold the product to begin with.  When I have spoken to virgin about the account they informed me that if I was able to send proof they would write off the debt as a gesture of goodwill. I sent in proof of incarceration and from then on matters with virgin have got worse.  Today I took it to a complaint  within the call centre as it had gone on too long, I was patronised by an utterly incompetent 'manager' called Leanne after I had been kept on hold for 30 minutes (on a 0871 number!!!) I explained the situation, she then bluntly told me that he has signed the contract and therfore had a duty to pay. When I elaborated that the guy I work with in unable to read and write and was clearly taken advantage of and miss - sold the product by the sale's man she was unsympathetic and said they were unable to reduce the balance. Virgin Media record calls, but informed me they are only listened to for training purposes... so as a result they are unwilling to listen to the call to find out if I was misinformed and unwilling to listen to find out whether or not someone called when he was incarcerated...  I find this company's conduct completely unacceptable in their treatment of vulnerable people.

Then last year, Virgin Media announced that because it was such a good company and needed to remain competitive, it was increasing its prices way above inflation.  I disputed this and communicated with Virgin Media over the internet using their website chat.  The representative of Virgin Media misled me and indicated that if I agreed to stay with them for 12 months, my prices would be fixed for 24 months and I would get a free phone line.  I agreed to this.  A few months later, I received a letter from Virgin Media stating that they were such a good company and to remain competitive they would increase my prices way above inflation.  I disputed this again and the attitude of Virgin Media is that I need to read the small print and they can do what they like.  I took the case to the ombudsman and the ombudsman ruled that due to the Virgin Media contract, they are within their rights.  I have sinced moved home and now live in an area that is not serviced by Virgin Media.  Virgin Media have added disconnection charges to my final bill, which has multiplied the cost.  I have disputed this and Virgin Media have put a black mark against my credit history, which is otherwise exemplary.  I will be taking legal action against Virgin Media for making my credit more expensive because this will cost me money if I need credit.  Whenever I try to get through to Virgin Media, I end up speaking to somebody in their Indian call centre.  They can't make any decisions and cannot even ask for somebody from the UK to call me.

4173,"Recently I upgraded from Sky to VM, not being happy with Sky's poor broadband speeds even though they claim up 20Mbps. I ended up getting the VM Premiere Collection and so far I haven't looked back. I got this mainly because of the 100Mbps broaband and I thought we might as well switch over our TV package as well just for convenience. Doing a wired speed test I get on average a whopping 85Mbps! And remember, even though you pay for a 100Mbps, data is lost from the box on the road down the coax cable to your home, so you will never get the full speeds you want, regardless of who you are with - what matters is the percentage of data you get of what you pay for. But there is a but. We have a loft conversion and our router is located on the 1st floor of the house, meaning WiFi signal is poor in the loft; it's very good on the ground floor, however. Because of this poor signal I get poor download speeds, meaning I'm not getting the most out of my internet package up here. Unfortunately, this isn't something an ISP can solve for you because this is a problem with regards to your environment. Also, WiFi speeds are no where near as reliable as an ethernet connection! This is fact. But we never want to be wired up and restricted with our freedom of movement. So, the only way you can get around this is by being ingenious, spending a little money and being a bit of a geek, I'm afraid. If you can fulfill that criteria then you can do what I've done, which is buy another router (a good one that is dualband), flash it with a custom firmware (I used DD-WRT), and use it as a wireless repeater. There are tutorials on the internet that will assist you if you're not sure what to do or where to start (however, you MUST be computer literate and be comfortable with what you're doing!). Furthermore, I bought a dualband wireless adapter to take advantage of the 5Ghz band and WiFi speeds. Since doing this, I went from 25Mbps download speeds to 70Mbps download speeds - in the LOFT!  With Sky I got a measily 5Mbps and I did everything I could to make it better to no avail. With Virgin I get 70% of the speeds I pay for through WiFi and the package I pay for is Â£5 cheaper than what I was paying for Sky.  I have given 3 stars for Customer service because I haven't been with them long enough to give a decisive rating on that one. Broadband reliability is good, not amazing, haven't had any real issues though. I hope I have answered any questions you may have had.

Network engineers are so supposed to keep on top of the daily maintaining of the network but all theu can do is try and keep it worming as best they can as virgin have now pulled the budget yet again and there is no money for upgrades.engineers are told to tell customers that the network is fine and the is no problems but we know different. The cab network is a mess 90% of street cabinets are full and all that happens when new customer comes on board is they use a splitter in the cab to share the power down the rg11 or rg6 cable to your house. And to be honest unless you are top tap port in the cabinet you are go to have problems.And all that will happen is another engineer will come out and just swap the tap over to another port whicb means they take someone off service and put yours on there tap port simpme job done and when they do red tools test it comes back with green no one knows any different.engineers are hit on a monthly basis with massive under achievable kpi,s which then helps the company claw money back from engineers.and this is just a tip of the iceberg of what afm,s tell there engineer,s to make sure they get pass results and also bully the engineers into making sure they get 10 out of 10 on nps scores  from customers.i feel sorry for anyone who is with virgin media now and this will only get worse my advice would be tv with sky and fibre broadband from BT i have had BT in for year now and constantly get 84mbits and not dropped off once",2.0

Thanks. I called up once again, desperate, explaning my situation. That id gotten sick last year, that i claimed for benefits as my SSP wouldnt cover my expenses and my employer did not offer any sick pay, that my claim is still not resolved 8 months later, that id gone in debt, that id lost my home ... They were still stone cold, told me straight out i should have made better life choices. As if my chronic illness is my fault. They referred to the terms and conditions and saying id comitted to a legal contract. Fair enough. I did. I asked if they would have any third party costs for me disconnecting my contract 6 months ahead of time, they said no. This means they will not have any costs for me disconnecting, but still demanding Â£172.50 in disconnection fee. It is their choice. I understand it is a contract. But to ask a company to have a shread of humanity, some empathy, that is just out of the question. So as I will not get any help from Virgin media to deal with the horrble situation i am already in, I would just like to warn anyone who MIGHT ever get sick, get in an accident, get divorced or have any other major life event rumble up your economy to please please do not get into a contract with Virgin Media.

Then he said there was no signal on the cable and we needed the construction team to run a new cable to our property. I told him we have no internet and he assured us we'll receive a call from his manager within 20 mins as soon as he's off the conference call he was having.

4191,"Virgin Media is one of the most difficult companies to contact I've ever had the displeasure of being a customer for. At the beginning of October (2013) I'd sorted out the Way Leave form which sought permission from my Letting Agency to install their services. This was sorted and an installation date was set. It is now January (2014) and I still do not have internet. In this period, the maintenance officer came to install my internet but found an issue with the wiring on the street outside my flat. Thus the Construction Team at Virgin Media were sought to do some simple work. I understand it is common for broadband to be the most difficult of utilities to setup but it seemed to me that Virgin Media are an absolute shambles. The only communication I've received from them is the occasional letter to confirm continual delays to the installation. When deadlines have passed, it has been me who has had to call them in order to follow up whether the work has been done (costing me over the odds to wait on average 10 minutes to talk to someone at Virgin Media's call centre). It will be interesting to see just how long this seriously poor customer service continues, as I've now decided not to call them anymore (it was getting too expensive). What are you playing at Virgin Media?",2.0

4194,"Somewhat astonished that every broadband supplier listed on this site attracts more negative comment than either balanced or positive comment! I've been with Virgin Media for many years.  I buy all three services (broadband, television and telephone) via cable/fibre from Virgin Media.  Virgin Media inherited my account from NTLworld. Overall, the broadband package serves its purpose reasonably well.  Up to now, I am a relatively light user of broadband - emails, surfing, the occasional streaming of DJ-less radio on Sunday - but am starting to think about replacing the television with on-line equivalents. Occasionally, I work from home.  In the UK morning, I can establish a VPN connection with my UK office, and the network connection is almost as fast as being physically present on the UK office network.  The UK office broadband connection is also provided by Virgin Media (corporate connections).  Between about 1pm to 5pm UK time, although the speed of the VPN connection slows, but non-VPN traffic continues to run at a useful speed. However, over the years, between 5pm and 7pm UK time, the broadband connection sometimes fails for up to 10 minutes at a time.  Sometimes, the modem remains connected, but reports no IP addresses.  At other times, the modem reports no connection at all. I have complained to Virgin Media about this issue before.  The usual response is to swap the cable modem and check the connection strength.  This shows some willingness to show the customer that Virgin will seek to fix complaints, but swapping modems doesn't solve any server-side DNS/DHCP issues, neither will it overcome any traffic management policy (if any exists). Virgin does not offer an instant service level agreement.  If you have a problem, Virgin will do through some basic checks before arranging home visits.  Home visits frequently need to be booked one week in advance (in my experience), and you'll need to trash a day of paid-leave, or a weekend, or throw a sickie, for an engineer to arrive between 8am to 6pm, then do 15 minutes of work (typically swap the modem and test it).  In all cases, engineers visiting home have left only when the service has been restored. I have more issues with the television service than the broadband service.  My main issue with the television service is that Virgin, like everybody else, resells only bundles of channels.  Nearly all the channels you can buy are funded by advertising.  If the advertising can fund the channel, then why I do need to pay to receive this said channel of advertising?  What exactly am I buying here?!  The advertisers should be paying me!!!  To be honest, it's an issue for the Competition Commission.  However, with improved broadband speeds and the reliability of cable broadband, it might be possible to stream on-demand items from the BBC and do away with the television service altogether. Something to talk about in 2014!",2.0

4205,Virgin broadband is absolutely abysmal I have numerous complaints. Firstly the speed is terrible I know it can differ at times of day but I have never exceeded 1 mb/s which for 30 mb/s stated is terrible. The super hub is garbage often loosing connection. The service is unreliable and is frequently down especially during bad weather. And lastly the customer service from the call centres based abroad is terrible there knowledge only reaches to 'turn the power off wait 2 minutes and turn it back on' and 'I will book an engineer' and due to the large volume of connection errors these engineers take up to 2 weeks to come. If I weren't tied up in a 12 month contract I would ditch Virgin tomorrow and wouldn't recommend them to anybody absolutely terrible service.,2.0

4261,Virgin offer a great service and the bundle package for Â£19.00 is great then they stick Â£11.99 line rental on it and that is what spoils it if someone is having phone tv and broadband the least you can do is knock the Â£11.99 line rental off i now have a tv which we only watch gold on a land line i dare not use except at weekends when calls are free and a broadband connection that is great the first company to offer all this or just broadband without line rental will corner the market on telephone landlines and internet users i am more than happy with my broadband but if it says broadband for Â£5.00 then it should be for Â£5.00 with no hidden costs if there is line rental to pay then this should be made clear so you cannot get broadband for Â£5.00 but for Â£16.99 and there should be no rise after 3 months if you want to get customers then be clear on prices and what you are selling it is price that has driven me away from virgin and by this date 09/10/2010 i have only been with virgin for 2 weeks if there is no change it will end.,2.0
4262,"I used their service with an XL broadband, recently got an email from Virgin Media Sales to the account holders email address stating I could upgrade to XXL Broadband for only an additional Â£8 per month, phoned the number listed and after numerous people they told me I would have to pay an extra Â£18 per month for the offer even though there is nothing in the t's & c's which support this additional tenner! Customer Services has one person who helped, though the rest were just interested in transferring me to other departments stating they couldn't help but perhaps x could! Currently in the complaints process, sending a copy to Ofcom as I believe this breaks with advertising regulations. Wish everyone else the best of luck... P.s. 20mb line regular testing achieves 18mb+",2.0
4263,Very reliable service providing good speed - maybe need to refresh the modem once in a while to maintain top speeds plus they provided a new modem last year which obtained the 20mb or at least 18-19mb. Can't fault them except their service is expensive and what I pay bears no relation to the low prices currently advertised.  I am thinking of changing but I know I will miss the reliable & fast cable service so might just see if they can offer a better price deal. Their tv is good and I can't really fault them.,2.0
4264,"Shocked at how good the customer service was. Called them last night re problem with phone line.  They offered engineer visit next day and Â£10 compensation without me even asking.

Ok, I get a discount  because i have the xl tv package as well but its still a lot of money especially as its not reliable, Ive just recently had an engineer out to rectify a fault which stopped my broadband from working for almost two weeks, there is at the moment a wait of one week before an engineer can come out to you, this tells me that either they are desperatly short of staff, or, they are having so many problems that their engineers are struggling to cope, either way I'm not impressed. Finally, the most irratating thing is having to try and understand the person you are speaking to on the phone, as more often as not it is someone in India that speaks with a strong dialect and so fast that it is hard to make out what they are saying.P.S The TV service isn't much more reliable either.",2.0

I can see a court case coming.",2.0
4271,I have been with them for about 5 years now. Customer service has improved a lot and if I need to call they no longer use premium rate numbers and calls are answered very promptly. The main problem is the email service which seems to very problematic lately often being down hours on end and smetimes most of the day!  I also have recently had a lot of problem acessing webmail when in the USA which I am hoping has been resolved now that its changed to Googlemail.

4273,Well where to start ...I thougt I would get a great deal on tv phone & bb for the past 10 months I had to call 5 times about their bb so then when I rang to find how near I was to end of contract I was told if I wanted to give 6 weeks notice I would have to pay early termination or ring back in 2 weeks to give a normal months notice to get out of that clause.Over the next 2 days they came back & quoted Â£27 for just tv when I originally enquired about just tv being quoted Â£67 then over the weekend they cut my phone off which I hadn't asked for then when rectifying this I was told it would be    2hours now the tv has stopped working. I don't think I will be ressuming as a tv only customer now !,2.0

Quite simply the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced, offshore helpdesks that don't understand english coupled with onshore staff who lie just to get you off the phone. I have put two written complaints through as well verbal complaints without response.
