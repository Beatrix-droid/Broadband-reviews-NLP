1,"a truly attrocious service  both in terms of broadband and customer services. my broadband has had issues from day 1 of the service and was told to increase my broadband package to improve this. i paid more for this and even then the service kept cutting out during important zoom calls.  their customer services does not have a clue and all they seem to want you to do is reboot your router several times.   the final straw came when i was left without broadband for over a week so decided i had had enough and was going to cancel the service. when i called to cancel the services they said their computer system was down so could not cancel my service.  3 days later and i am still waiting for my services to be cancelled.  this really is appalling and would recommend anyone who is considering moving to virgin media to stop and rethink.",1.0
2,they make it as hard as they can for you to cancel a contract. i was on the phone for 2 hours  had t o spend 20 minutes convinving the first agent i wanted to cancel  who then put me on hold for 1+hours waiting for a different agent. that agent hung up as soon as we connected. two days later i'm not in a text chat that will apparently take all day. don't use them! you don't want to have to go through this!,2.0
3,"pay for the 350mbps package but only ever managed 250mbps  upload only 34 of the 50 adverised. router is garbage  5g wifi drops out and all other interfaces reset when it happens.  settings often disappearing  customer service not a great experience",2.0
4,"the worst customer service:-the bots ask irrelevant questions-after many questions you can be told they cant help as they are too busy-you go through security and then get transferred to whatsapp-you then have to go through security againlong waiting times between answers on whats app  up to 10-15 minutes-questions have no bearing to the issue  its like a bot again-loads of copy and paste: dont worry  i know how u feel  i would be too  but never get to the issue  its like a bot again-was told the information they have access to is limited so they end up asking you questions  such as  did you receive an email  who did u speak to  etc-silly policies dictate illogical offers-orders will get cancelled without explanations -support is an exercise going through the motionsthe most frustrating",2.0
5,informed we were being given an upgrade  but there was no difference to the speeds after rebooting the hub,3.0
6,"i wish i can give a zero star to virgin media but unfortunately the lowest star is 1. if you intend joining a network and don't want your bills to keep increasing without being informed then please don't make the mistake of joing virgin media. they are set of liars and they lied to me in may 2019 that if i join there network i will pay â£33 pounds for 18 month contract. after 4 month of being with virgin media  they increase there price to â£59 pounds month  which wasn't what they initially told me. when i realised that they've increased there monthly bill  i had to end the contract  because i ended the contract they further bill me of â£102.27  a bill that i never used and insisted that i have to pay  they began to send the debt collector to disturb me about the payment  they spoilt my credit rating as they reported the case to the credit authority and my credit has been affected by them.if you love your credit report  and don't want to keep on paying extra bills in comparison with what you initially agree  don't join virgin media.lastly  when i saw that they've gone a bit further to spoil my credit report  i contacted them to voice out my complain  one of there customer service listened to my complain and confirmed that my bills have been written off via there online chat service  after 2 weeks of confirming that my bill have been written off  they came back to say that was not what they meant that i still have make payment of â£102.27. i showed them the evidence that confirms that my bill has been written off  but they said written off means i will have to pay. i wonder how stupid this people are that they taught they are tricking a kid. in conclusion  if you love your credit score and don't want excessive bills after some certain month of joining a network  please don't attempt joining virgin media  they are liars looking for ways to extort customers.",1.0
7,i was sold a package for 1gb speed and 2 tivo box 6 but when i ask for it they act like i am not given those. get everything in proper writing. their sales team are there to just put you on a contract and then they remove what is promised.,2.0
8,"quite simply you don't get what your sold. for example if you are say switching from bt 67mb package to virgins 108 mb package you will notice the following.1  your actual wi fi speeds will more than likely be slower than bt. id say i got an average of 30mb download speed compared to about 50+ with bt.2  your wi fi signal from the hub 3 will not have the range compared to the bt hub 23  speaking to someone is near impossible unless you book a day off work to sit on the phone on the plus side i found it more reliable than bt but maybe ive been lucky?",3.0
9,virgin is just the worse broadband company. iâve been trying to book an engineer for months and finally got it booked last week for monday  7th november  and guess what???? i called them on monday to confirm the visit and they said it wasnât booked,1.0
10,"very rude and unhelpful. i tried to make a complaint  but the call handler refused to put me through to a manager and said âall complaints are through herâ and i wouldnât get a follow up response. i tried to raise a complaint on the website but the link wasnât working.  iâm incredibly disappointed! iâve been overcharged  and was promised a â£68.72 refund. iâve received â£14. i cannot face going through another ordeal again.  virgin you win  but you will never have my business again!",2.0
11,"absolutely useless service  no communication and treat the customer the worst i had  received a payment overdue from them a few days ago and all of a sudden they cut my internet connection. i do have a direct debit with them every month which i am paying my monthly bill. had  attached my bank statements to them by email and was expecting  from them  to fix my internet connection promptly and apologise for their mistake or compensate me for all this days that i have to pay from my pocket to have some internet at home but after 5 days nobody communicate with me  when i try to call them the automatic answer machine says that my account is freezed and have to do the payment for them to be able to unfreeze it literally i don't have words to express my frustration i will certainly discuss it with my solicitor and get another broadband that cares about their customers",2.0
12,i can't describe how bad is the internet connection 4 weeks now i have to use my mobile data so i can work 3 times i book a appointment for technical services to come and check and 3 times they cancelled and the best is that when i called they said we check and everything is working fine just i don't know what else to do.,2.0
13,"wifi is usually fast and up to expected speed stated in the package. we used the 200 mb student plan. occasional service outage especially during heat waves in summer  unfortunately due to the old infrastructure in our area.  satisfactory customer service. waiting time is usually around 40 minutes  better than most other companies  for example the energy companies  try not to be a customer of sse btw . installation was quick and on time. we were able to cancel the service on the whatsapp customer service  which took about an hour of discrete chat with one of their moving team members. but the response was concise and helpful. personally i find this reasonable given the huge demand.  it took 3 months for them to send us the self-return package though  although that has not incur any extra charges.",3.0
14,rubbish incompetent company who mess you about and pass you from pillar to post.,1.0
15,one month with no internet and no one answer customer service,2.0
16,"this company and this service are a joke for the price they make you pay. it's not acceptable that a capital city like london allows this scam game. i've been with them for almost two years.. initially it was kind of okay  but in the last 6 months their service became completely hopeless. i traveled a lot around the world and i never experienced this amount of outage  not even in remote areas. this time i am without broadband since two weeks  and they kept moving the fixing date  they were probably clueless . today it was supposed to finally get fixed  but guess what.. nothing. i called and they say that the outage in the area has been resolved  but that an ""engineer"" is needed to reconnect the router  magically . now the story get even funnier. a serious company  after a serious problem like this  would try to push for accelerating the process  but this scam will send an engineer 4 days from now. it's simply not acceptable. they don't care at all about their customers and their service is the worst ever. plus  if you don't actively call hundred of times they will not update you at all. fortunately i will leave this service soon. dear reader  please be aware!",1.0
17,"disgusting service. they might be a little bit cheaper than sky but my god if you have a problem. spent the last 3 days on the phone and waited in for the last 2 for an engineer to come out for nobody to come  the customer service reps just keep lying and setting up another appointment to which nobody even arrives. i will not be going with them again just in case i ever have an issue.",1.0
18,"i know it is a slight cliche to say this but i truly would not give any stars for this review and i encourage anyone thinking of using this service to not use virgin media. it is the 7th week now we have had no internet service. we have been told that the piping holding the cables has collapsed somehow  ???  and they are going to come and lay a new cable. today was the 5th time we waited for the engineer to turn up and again nobody came. it feels like the customer service folk are basically lying or do not know what they are saying. it is often the case when you call customer service they pass you around until someone creates a fake date when some fake engineers will turn up. so in essence it is a disaster. its funny when it was working it was fine but now there is a problem  yep they can not or will not deal with it. luckily our contract has ended  we just joined sky  instalation in a week with 400 odd new channels. yep not as fast as virgin but whats the use of fast broadband when it doesn't work for weeks on end! oh and whilst we aee waitinf we get full access to sky go the app. so yeah when one door closes etc.  avoid avoid avoid virgin media",1.0
19,would be zero if i could put it. absolute worst service provider i have ever dealt with. had it installed and the 20th september and have not had one week of straight service. had a whole month of no tv service. my partner has had to miss multiple days of work due to no internet and working from home and it is putting his job at risk  not to mention the financial hit we've had to take for him not getting paid as he is not able to work. i would stay very clear because they have a different issue and excuse every week and 6 weeks in still have an outage every week that takes at least 24 hours for them to sort and 24 hours is on a good day. absolute horrendous experience.,1.0
20,my contract was coming to an end  and virgin wanted to increase my price to â£38.25 per month. after searching  i found more competitive prices. i called virgin media to ask if there was anything that they could do with the price  and they went away and said  there was something they could do with the price........... increase it to â£46 !!!!!!!!! needless to say  i went elsewhere.,1.0
21,"if you need your broadband urgently  i warn you to stay away from this provider. their customer service suck. when they want to sell their service  they are nice  friendly and promise a fast delivery. but you definitely wonât get the service at the scheduled time. they are not reliable. they have been delaying the set-up of my broadband service for two months and they postponed the appointments 4 times without informing me.  2 months ago  i moved to a new house and immediately called virgin media to set up my broadband  as i needed the internet connection urgently which is very critical for my job and their fiber line was already available for the new house and they just needed to send their technicians to set up the service  and they have rescheduled the appointment 4 times so fa. hence after two months i still donât have access to the internet. last month when they rescheduled the set-upt time for the third time  i was so frustrated and called them more than 10 times to get a proper explanation and nobody gave me one but they apologized and promised to set it up today. however  i noticed they postponed the set-up to the next month again  this is the fourth time  and even they havenât bothered to contact me and inform me. such a shame. poor service  poor customer support  and poor technical support. there are better providers and i hardly recommend you to subscribe for another broadband service.",1.0
22,"so when we first signed up to virgin your delivery company yodl weâre absolutely useless and we kept failing to deliver. we couldnât contact them directly and repeated calls to virgin customer service proved futile in resolving the matter. this heavily affected our work from home commitments and caused much stress. eventually i changed the address and we finally received the hub 2-3 weeks late. then we had a complaint in august and were credited a one-off resolution credit of â£24 that was never applied. then i used their customer services three times to resolve it to no avail. 2 phone calls also proved futile. then i told the customer service agent i will cancel my direct debit as the credit we had been promised  which they said they would send  would cover our last bill. the credit  of course  never arrived. then we received a late payment charge which is just beyond frustrating and the audacity is unbelievable.  then i tried to cancel the contract and they point blank kept refusing ignoring me and offering me different tariffs.  i have never experienced such horrific customer services from any company ever.  avoid at all costs update 30.10.22 - : virgin media have now cut us off  despite in our last conversation saying they will resolve the matter and i will receive email confirmation of the resolution. of course  no email came. if you're looking for a broadband provider  i implore you  do not choose virgin media. you will regret it",2.0
23,do not be fooled by virgin media . i have been a loyal customer for years yet they fail to do what they say. i am still awaiting a manager to call me back 3 weeks later nothing! spoken to a million advisors yet nothing has been resolved! i was promised i would pay â£44 yet being charged â£72! what a bloody joke! just scammers thats what these guys are! unprofessionals who just want ur money!,2.0
24,"if you value your own time and sanity you will avoid virgin at all costs. i cannot begin to explain the awful experience that i have had with them... the customer service is the worst i have seen. something as simple as cancelling my services because i moved house ended up with a default on my credit score and lost me the sale of a property. that is a very simple overview of what happened  but i have wasted 6 months of my life trying to sort something so simple and you just get passed from team to team  because apparently none of them are the ""right team"" to cancel a service. avoid they have yet again threatened me with charges and are holding me to ransom because they haven't collected their kit... which has been arranged 4 times.",1.0
25,"my personal advice is to stay away from virgin at all costs. the customer service is so appalling and will drive you to despair. trust me as well  you will need to call them at some point.we were due to move home as our contract was running out  so i spoke with virgin  and they were very kind to offer me a temporary 3-month extension on my wi-fi. i rang yesterday to now cancel my contract as i am within the 60 days of the end  and they are denying that 3 months exists  and i would have to pay for 18 months.  this despite it clearly showing on my records. they are claiming that i was promised it  but it is not legitimate. irony is i am not surprised. if you wish to keep your sanity stay away from this company.",2.0
26,not even worth 1 star to be honest. iâm a new customer  1month in  and iâve been without a phone line  broadband or tv for three days now. incredibly difficult to get through to a customer service operative and when you finally do  you are fobbed off and or cut off. the worst customer service experience iâve ever had. problem is still not resolved. do not sign up to virgin media  itâs a total waste of money and time. iâve had bt  sky and talktalk in the past and they were all far superior. really regret signing a contract with virgin.,2.0
27,"i'm beginning to believe this is somehow personal  otherwise this shows how really incompetent virgin media is. the moment we left our previous supplier and went with virgin media we have been having issues. the issue started with the lines somehow being crossed  therefore whenever my phone rang so did my neighbours and vice versa which meant we were privy to each others conversations. i should have cancelled immediately.  i live in a small flat  with an average wall separating the area from my broadband box. for years i struggled to get adequate network in my bedroom which would be 12 feet at the most if i could walk through the walls. countless phone calls and it was still the same. i still stayed! during the covid lockdown and just as it was easing i wanted to have access to local news etc as i was only watching catch ups... i called virgin and settled on a plan for broadband  telephone and virgin media  with promises that the broadband strength would increase  needless to say i still had the same issues. in addition for whatever reason at the time virgin media was not connected.  virgin continued with the same plan  collecting the same amount despite not setting up virgin media. i don't know why i persisted with virgin but i did. recently i've had enough and decided that they're either gonna do better or i'm gonna switch. they gave me hell to get my number  a number which does not belong to them as i moved over to them with my number from my previous supplier. in any event  that number is used as a business number so we cannot just let it go. after all the trouble and stress of the process we relented again and decided to stay as it was creating so many issues and anxiety. we again agreed on a plan for virgin media again  broadband and telephone. while the network has improved my telephone has stopped working. about two weeks ago an engineer was scheduled to do the tv  but claimed he could not because he wasn't sure he could do a good enough job of not having wires everywhere. we were then offered a streaming box. that would work without wire connection  but that would mean one box when the agreement was to have two boxes installed. i requested another engineer come out as the other one really didn't seem to walk to take the work on. the agreed time was for 9am a few days later. 9am came and went  it was not until about 4pm after multiple phone calls that the engineer came  while i stayed home from work to accommodate that visit. we had a run through of the property  came up with a plan that was suitable and was promised a call to arrange installation. it's been over a week and i'm still waiting for that phone call!!! virgin is gonna send me a bill for over â£115 when i have no phone and definitely no tv!!!! an engineer was meant to visit today at 4pm to fix the phone line and should i say i'm still waiting  or is it safe to go ahead and stop waiting? i'm also still waiting for a senior personnel to give me a ring. i contacted virgin whatsapp chat and as i type i'm still waiting almost two hours to be connected to an agent. is it that i'm too patient  gullible  stupid or all of the above.  virgin media you are the worst company i've had the misfortune of letting into our home!",1.0
28,vey bad company!! please stay away from them! today is another day i cannot work from home because they couldnt sort it out their broadband issue inmy area since july!!! 4 months! they have also rubbish customer service. paying â£65 per month and cannot get any service from them!,1.0

30,"virgin broadband or virgin media have to be one of the worst service providers in the uk. yeah they provide fast internet but if it works less than half the time what the point? their customer service is even worse  you make a complaint and they don't contact you back and just close the complaint and mark it as resolved. if a company is taking your money and not providing the service in return  surely this is a scam?!  go with anyone else  or just get two cups and a peice of string if you need something reliable.",2.0
31,i rate the service 0. this is the worst customer service i have experienced. it was a simple issue that we needed resolving due to them taking wires out without our consent. then they we have to wait 2 weeks for this to be rectified. we got placed on long holds or the advisor would be silent for minutes on end. got passed to complaints to just be hung up on before speaking to anyone and constant service from everyone was appalling. glad we ended up not going with this provider.,2.0
32,i signed up for broadband and tv in august.  already facing problems. no tv and broadband since fri. my daughter have gcse and my other daughter works from home. when called they said it can be 30 days. when called customer services  they said nothing we can do. except wait for engineer.i wish i had never signed up to virgin. i had never gone without internet or tv with bt and sky. big mistake and bog blunder.  i wouldn't even give one star,1.0
33,virgin media has become dreadful and it's customer service is appalling.,1.0
34,"we secured a good deal with virgin media for broadband in 2020. as soon as our contract ended  june 2022  they hiked our prices up by almost 100%. i called to explain that it was unaffordable  i'd also been made redundant and financially we were struggling. the rep at virgin was completely uninterested and offered a ""take it or leave"" amount that still resembled an 80% increase on our original tariff. i therefore chose to switch service providers which we did  then called virgin to cancel and they made it as difficult as humanly possible to do this - the women in the cancellations department actually argued that it was our fault for not being more proactive in reviewing our contract pricing. another sign we had made the right choice by leaving. i then received multiple calls each day over a week from virgin sales reps offering prices better than our original package  must've been shy on sales targets but nowhere to be seen when i reached out... obviously by this point we're already with a new provider so it wasn't possible. they then issued an outstanding payment notice claiming we had to give 30 days notice to cancel and slapped a ""late payment fee"" on top of the value of the unjustifiably hiked tariff. despite being out of contract. this is the corporate equivalent of bullying - virgin see us as consumers  not people. numbers not individuals. the value of the outstanding amount means nothing to virgin media  but might mean something to an individual. do they care? absolutely not. they are only interested in your pockets so just be wary if you go with them. my advice would be not to following what's been a pretty inhumane and disgraceful experience. judging by their score here  it's pretty consistent too. too busy building ""rockets"". what a joke.",1.0
35,"worst company i have ever deal with. i signed up to a contract which offer an introductory discount. after i had placed my order  virgin media did not honour the discount. i complained multiple times and these emails contained cut and paste responses  but nothing helpful. they said they were unable to find anything which confirmed the offer on their end and after sending them a copy of the contract they had sent to me  they ignored my emails. in addition  they repeatedly got my name wrong in the replies on webchat and some emails. i asked for a letter of deadlock which was ignored and i asked them to cancel my services which they also ignored. luckily i have now managed to cancel my contract via a telephone call which was also unnecessarily complicated but i have learnt my lesson. do not go with the cheapest company  they are cheap for a reason. it is worth it to pay a bit extra to get good customer service. i am also in the process of complaining to cisas as virgin media are knowingly falsely advertising their products.",2.0

48,"2.5 weeks ago i called to rejoin with virgin media in my new address. i made a 18 month contract for broadband and i have been told iâll receive my installation plug in box on tuesday 20 09 2022.i have been told that the property has been provided with fiber before so there will be all the available plugs to connect your broadband and start using your services. a week after i get a call from one of the providers trying to offer me virgin media packages. after i informed the customer service that i already have an ongoing order place and that my box is late for delivery he informed me that there is no order under this name. i provided my account details and i sent my contract so he can check and he can verify that the account exist in the order is there. eventually he found the order and he apologized as the person i spoke before forgot to do the credit check so the order never been through. i never got an email that the order is not been through or is cancel i just had a contract in my email saying that the delivery is going to be on that tuesday. he informed me then that this order has to be canceled and a new order has to be placed so after providing all my details again a new your order was placed. they told me cause the offer i booked wasnât available anymore and i should book a new deal which was 5 pounds extra monthly. i told him that didnât want to continue so they offer me the package i had before. after the order was gone through i check the contract and they set the wrong delivery address after i specifically specified that i would like my box to be delivered to a different address. after calling again i managed to change the delivery address and i finally received the installation box. however the installation box doesnât include the appropriate plugs to connect the broadband and the technician has to come to sort my broadband connection. i asked when can this happen and the only available slot for the technician is next week on thursday 06 10 for which i have to take a day off from work so i can be home . i really cannot understand the whole process and how unprofessional and company like this can be. i asked for the technician to be around this week but they told me that it has to be booked end it takes a week. iâve been with virgin media for a while now and iâve never had such issues.  i really not appreciate all this trouble and stress i have to go through for just a broadband contract.",2.0

58,"it should be as easy to unsubscribe from a service as it is to sign up. other than powerful brand bullies  who is against this? i gladly signed up with virgin media for an eighteen month broadband contract in march 2021. the process was rapid  the price very competitive  until my deal ended  when it became absurdly un-competitive  but i knew that going in  and the service good. when fibre broadband was installed in my area there was no way virgin or any other traditional provider would be able to compete  so  playing along with the unnecessarily restrictive rules about their timing of cancellations  read the small print  i took an afternoon off to unsubscribe  thanks to feedback i was prepared . cancelling requires a seemingly inescapable charade of aggressive renegotiation  just offer me your best price upfront please  we don't live in some medieval bazaar . i was then hassled for weeks with ""better"" offers at all hours of the day from a variety of different phone numbers  making it difficult to block. for reasons known only to virgin  my service was cancelled four days before my contract ended and i was  ludicrously  billed a few pounds for an early disconnection charge. because the company had proved so inconvenient to negotiate with regarding cancellation  i paid it  which is presumably their bad faith strategy. then  i was almost immediately threatened with further billing despite returning my virgin media equipment within 24 hours of receiving their packaging  now resolved  but we'll see . i kept transcripts of exchanges  and am advising other existing customers to do the same  as the culture demonstrated suggests they are not to be trusted. i can't imagine what it would be like dealing with virgin media in case of bereavement or other personal crisis. if anyone from virgin ever reads this  please know: it is unlikely that making it extremely inconvenient to turn off the service is going to dissuade someone from doing it. it hurts a once respected brand  will demotivate your employees and destroys loyalty. it is short term-thinking and depressingly lazy. but you do it anyway. just look at the reviews amassing on trustpilot. when organizations get too big and too short-term focused to pay attention to the market  itâs a perfect moment for consumers to band together and give them a guardrail. if i can sign up with a few clicks  i should be able to withdraw my custom with a few clicks. i rent my london flat  so when i move i may not have fibre broadband as an option  and will likely require another provider. it won't be virgin media  and a once loyal customer will now repeat this complaint across any platforms that allow me to leave a review. pity.",4.0

79,disappointing braodband and even bigger disappointment with regards to customer service. i have been a virgin media broadband customer for three years previously in a different city and it was great. no problems at all. unfortunately in brighton the broadband was awful and when i reported the slow speeds and the constant cutting out i was made to feel very small and incompetent. virgin media were not interested in the slightest and just kept saying that their end said there werenât any issues. they eventually sent out an engineer who also didnât resolve anything and just told us we were at the end of the line. to finish it off when my contract was up  virgin wanted a â£40 early disconnection fee as my tenancy was for a month less than my broadband contract. i decided to just pay the 12 months despite no longer being at the property. i was then contacted asking if i would terminate the contract early as someone else was moving into the property but i declined to pay the early disconnection fee. the person was quite insistent despite me making it obvious that their timing was most inconvenient and i asked if they could ring back at a more convenient time. they didnât ring again that evening as requested. i then rang them back to clarify what was going on and again i was asked if i wanted to pay the early disconnection fee  yet again i declined their kind offer to pay more money for a service i was no longer using. then out if the blue i received a final bill saying that my contract had been terminated without any consultation with myself. when i queried the bill i was told by the young man  i wonât name him as itâs probably not allowed  that virgin media could basically do whatever they liked with the contract or words to that effect and when i queried this statement he reneged and denied saying it  although sounding a little flustered. so disappointed this year with the poor service received after three previous contracts that went without any hitches at all. most phone conversations were discourteous and quite frankly rude at times ,1.0
80,"after paying virgin media my hard earned money for the past 20 years  when i desperately needed support due to my broadband going down they couldn't have cared less. despite explaining my hub was clearly broken and that i was in the process of starting a new business from home  they flat out refused to send out a new hub  unless i paid even more to upgrade  and told me i would have to wait a week for an engineer. unhappy with this  i told them i would find an alternative provider which i did. despite various phone calls to virgin and discussions with them via twitter  they failed to tell me i had to give 30 days cancellation until i called today to tell them i am now with talk talk and this is despite not even being in a contract. they basically told me it was my own fault for not being aware of the t&c's and not reading their cancellation policy. so now they intend to charge me for broadband i won't be using for the next month as its been disconnected when i moved to talk talk. had they informed me of this when i first told them i was leaving  i could have cancelled 3 weeks ago.disgusting company  appalling customer service and clearly have no value for customers. their customer representatives are insincere and unhelpful which is why i will now be actively discouraging others to choose them. and isn't it interesting that for all their insincere apologies when you complain  they never  ever offer anything other than an option to discuss it further i.e. continue banging your head against a brick wall as they frustrate you further because they really couldn't care less and will give nothing to compensate for their inadequate provision",2.0

113,if  for example  they start tripling your bill without prior warning  or change your bill date  or the speed slows or shuts down  you would have better luck burning some sage and peering through a crystal ball  than trying to get a hold of someone from customer service who will actually help. you'll be passed around like a joint for hours  or weeks in my case  no one takes responsibility for any case and sees it to the end  or makes relevant and helpful notes on your account for the next agent  so when you call again you have to recite a monologue and explain again until you descent into insanity. evidently overworked and undertrained staff  some seemingly incompetent. you're better paying a slight premium to avoid the trauma of dealing with virgin.,2.0

166,fairly reliable broadband and quite fast. goes down 5 or 6 times per year that i know of without explaination  but not the end of the world. my main gripe with virgin media is the constant price increases. theyâve crept my bill up from â£22 per month  up to â£47.50 per month  while still offering the â£22 service to new customers  may be â£24 now .  iâve just canceled with them and iâm going to try another provider.,2.0
167,service is good but conditions are awful. speed downgrade or contract cancellation requires 1 month notice even if it's after the ending of the current contract. the only way to negotiate a lower price is to arrange disconnecting from them. ending contract early may trigger a fee of â£240. where's the fiber competition in my area?,2.0
168,when it works good. get an a fault  for example spotty connection and after months still no b# ### good. customer service thinks if they ask the same questions and do the same 'adjustments' they will get a different result. and complaints dept. take at least 1 month between emails,2.0

170,wouldnât recommend absolutely useless  be told that someone will come out between 08-1:00 to take away the outside leads because we opted out of the contract and apparently no one can come out now because we opted outâ¦ if you go with virgin be prepared to get no help and false statements!,2.0
171,virgin media keeps increasing our broadband prices after 5 years of using their service. we used to pay â£26 a month just for broadband. its now â£48 a month after 5 years using their service . when i called the customer service  the advisor couple of times said that she would look in to my account and then disconnected my call after long wait and explaining the reasons. very unprofessional. avoid them at any cost.,2.0
172,customer service and cancellation team are utter trash. i have called 3 times to cancel their subscription far beyond the expiry of my contract as i have moved to another company. they have failed to cancel my contract 3 times even after receiving emails of cancellation as i am still getting emails of monthly payments that i now apparently for 3 months after cancellation. i'm not using your damn service and it's been cancelled with email confirmation. how am i still being charged monthly???,1.0

324,worst broadband service they always have area outage and service interruption. because of them i lost 3-4 days work every month. they don't send technician to your home  as there is an area outage. when i try to cancel the contract cancellation team asks you how many times engineer visited your home  at least three times a month an engineer has to visit before cancellation . but they wont send engineer to your home that easily. technical team and customer relationship team don't interacts - they ask customer to coordinate with two teams. overall its worst network and customer service.,1.0

330,not directly broadband issue but since most contracts are dealt with as a package...just putting this on here in hope it stops others suffering the same. my father has just had to move into a home due to terminal cancer  so my sister rang virgin media to have the phone contract for the family home changed into my mums name  they said that wouldnt be a problem but maybe at same time it was best to update the contract to a new version with a better deal. at this point nothing was ever detailed about any break in service. but then disaster strikes the landline is cut off and an along with that an emergency pull cord system that my mother needs due to severe ill health and disability is no longer active and when you ring up and spend an hour and a half explaining you are still told youll have to wait another 5 days at which point they might get you back online. totally disgraceful company. so people please be aware they dont tell you the consequences of changing contracts,1.0

371,i am actually writing a review on customer service more than anything. i have just moved from devon to sunderland. the provider i had in devon was not too good so i decided to go with virgin media as the previous owners had been with virgin and it seemed the easiest option. my router arrived exactly when it was meant to but i could not find where the router was meant to be connected. i was sooo frustrated. i went online  was asked when i wanted an appointment for an engineer to visit. i requested same day. two fantastic engineers arrived  adam and dave and fixed the problem. there wasnât actually a problem it was me being blonde but the service was brilliant. thanks vm.,2.0
372,"almost certainly the most dishonest  lying company i have ever dealt with in my life. we're paying for 213mb s and we can rarely get more than 5mb s  more than once it's dropped below 0.1. after they sent us the router it took 5 days to get any connection because they hadn't bothered to maintain their own infrastructure properly. the router has an effective range of about 5m  and if you want to get a booster so it'll actually cover the whole of your house  it costs you an extra â£5 a month - that is  when the boosters are in stock  which they never are. all of their customer service is automated  so it's basically impossible to talk to a human being who could actually be of any use. they frequently lie about their services: if you download the app it promises to ""optimise"" the wifi for you to eliminate blackspots. this makes absolutely no difference to your actual connection  and yet they still claim to have improved it every single time. while they were trying to sign me up they promised i'd have access to an individual advisor  daniel gray  in case i had any problems. i have tried to ring daniel gray 5 times in the last week and have sent him 2 emails and he has never yet responded to me: apparently he only wants to talk to me if he can sell me something. totally dishonest  nakedly greedy  transparently uninterested in the actual service they're providing so long as they can sign you up to pay them â£35 a month.",2.0

384,i'd rather shoot myself than use this company's services myself. everything was okay up until the point where we needed to cancel. booked an appointment after moving and explicitly told them my address and phone number. their people went to the wrong address  didn't call  and i found out that the customer service person didn't even update my address or phone details during the previous call. i was then told they updated both of these and that they booked a new appointment. sike  they didn't a few days later i received an email that they're charging me 40 quid for the unreturned kit that they themselves failed to pick up. i called them up  and they told me that they cannot guarantee pickup even when its booked. so why have a service like that then? they also said they cant track which collector does which appointment so no liability for any of them  and i am left with a 40 quid charge which is after i gave them the whole loadout of information 3 times. insane  i'd probably rather go without any internet than to go with vm,2.0

563,"firstly  for the actual service  i was with virgin media for 2 years. the deal was the most competitively priced for 100mbps speeds. throughout those two years the internet speeds never felt great  many days i would check the speed and it would be below 10mbps. virginâs terms and conditions make it difficult to challenge drops in speed. on the 27th march i switched provider to get 67mbps speeds for the same price  and honestly  the service has been far better and consistent. now to share my story at how awful it has been to move my services. middle of march 2021  i contact virgin via the web chat to make them aware iâm moving homes. they tell me they cannot offer 100mbps at the new home  that is fine  i put in a cancelation request. a few days later  i get a call from virgin telling me i can get those speeds at the new home and they offer me a good deal  i accept and share my details  such as my moving date  the 27th march. 20th march  virgin media terminate my existing broadband  7 days too early. leaving me to have to purchase and use data in order to do my job. to get reconnected took 4 hours 14 minutes  14 at least different calls . why so many calls? i would be reconnected to another department rather often  and just less than half the time  my call would be disconnected while being transferred. this happened roughly a dozen times from start to finish. i was reconnected after 4 days without broadband.  while the team helped me get reconnected  they brought it to my attention that the there is also a problem with the new property i asked to move my broadband to. they have to do some building work to get the broadband up to speed and this would take between 4-8 weeks  they said they would supply me with a dongle in the meantime. they gave me a number i had to text in order to sort out the dongle. i text the number it led to a conclusion that someone would call me within 24 hours to sort out the dongle. no one called. i text the number again  same conclusion someone will get back in touch. no one called. i text the number again  same conclusion someone will get back in touch. while this was going on  i was still phoning virgin to get reconnected  since it was a 4-day ordeal. while trying to get reconnected  i finally threw in the towel and said i donât want any services from virgin anymore  i would like to leave. the dongle was given up on as well. i went with a new provider ee  who have been great so far.  my final date with virgin media was the 27th march. i got a letter saying i was owed â£13 for my services being terminated in late march  since i did pay for the full month right at the start. i raised a complaint and they kindly offered me â£50 in a goodwill sorta thing for my troubles. this was confirmed in an email on 16 04 2021. fast forward to 10th may. i had still not received my credit. not only that  i was sent a letter that i owe virgin â£30ish. well 5 calls on the 10th  lasting a combined 4 hour 22 minutes consisting of a few disconnections  one disconnection happening 3 hours into a call  i find out that virgin never cancelled on the 27th march. they were still trying to charge me. and the credit i was promised was used to reduce these charges on my bills i never received. this has took out some of my credit score success since it appears iâve been missing some payments i had no idea about. during my 4 hour 22 minute worth of calls  i do speak to a lot of customer service reps. two of which are very helpful. they explain to me why i havenât had my credit  that iâm still with virgin apparently. they set me up to have my account cancelled  again  the following day. they tell me they will âremoveâ the charges between the 27th march and 11th may. and i may see my credit on my final bill. so i was expecting a final bill of â£63 credit  the â£50 from good will and the â£13 owed from march. nope on 12 05 2021 they still want â£9 off of me? despite getting letters of credit from them and myself and the customer reps agreeing that i was mistakenly still with virgin media after the 27th? so what are they charging me for? all in all  this is the worst product iâve paid for. the amount it has cost me in time and effort  when originally this all started just because i told them i was moving and would like to move my services. itâs ended up in me losing out on credit score  time  data and money. virgin lost a customer who was wanting to stick with them despite some drops in speed  because after all their prices are very good. no oneâs won. my ordeal continues to this day trying to not be charged and trying to get my credit although iâm less bothered by the credit at this point. i just want it to be over without conceding and paying an overdue amount. i would advise anyone reading this to never go with virgin media for anything. their prices are nothing more than a trap.",1.0

623,having been with virgin media for many years. we pay 76pounds month for an average tv package with landline weekend and evening calls.our last bill was 92 pounds. we pay for a 200m broadband speed but never get above 18.7mb download speed and sometimes its 10mb. according to this site virgin media average dounload speed is 105.49  how come mines is about 14? i have managed to communicate with them twice but what they say they will do never happens.i find it quite stressfull trying to communicate by phone as i have lost my password and my hearing is poor and sometimes you can wait nearly an hour in a q.i have written two lengthy letters explaining my predicament but they do not pick up on my complaints.i feel trapped in a corner when all i want is  a fair deal.also my new hub sits on red instead of .solid white and i cant get wifi in my summerhouse.it would be great if this review can help. would it be a good idea to change suppliers? i really am in a dilemma.if this review resolves my predicament i would behappy to recommend the site,2.0
624,absolutely ridiculous!!!! non-existent customer service. one of the hardest companies to leave. website for complaints is often down. phoning through for complaints or fixing an issue led to me being hung up on 5 times after waiting over an hour to be connected each time. virgin would not know competency if it was slap in the face with it. absolutely tired of this ****** company.,2.0
625,"tldr  avoid this company at all costs!if you're unfortunate to be with virgin already and have technical problems  call 08000527553 to skip the customer service waiting queue nightmare to go to the second line technical team directly  they answer in less than a minute . my personal experiencei've been plagued with issues with their internet since october 2020  and have literally spent 20+ hours  in the month of february alone  over the phone with them to try and explain my problems. we're now in march  i still don't have internet working properly and i can't wait for my contract to expire to move to another provider. horrendous customer servicethe customer service is a complete mess: getting someone over the phone is a lot more difficult than it should  probably to deter clients from calling. when i want to speak with someone  i often end up with an automated voice sending me a link on my mobile to ""troubleshoot my broadband connection issue"". technical nightmarewhen you finally manage to have someone over the line  they force you to go through meaningless troubleshooting  ""turn off and on your router""  even though the issue is unrelated  because they do not have the proper technical knowledge  i have a signal snr issue where the connection is up and down  disconnecting multiple times per day . they've sent a different engineer 5 times at my property: 2 times my isolator was replaced  and nothing else  and 2 times the engineers said the issue was with the network team  not them  one even refused to get out of his car claiming he didn't bring any face mask and only discussed by phone . at some point  i managed to get the second line technical team phone number  08000527553  and avoided discussing with the technical team  150 or 03454541111   which saved time as they only kept asking me to reboot my router to make it work.when the issue is finally raised to the proper team  don't think this will solve anything: this team has closed my fault ticket 7 times  !!  between the 26 january and the 4 march wrongly claiming my problem was fixed  and everytime i had to go through the hassle of re-explaining my issue  when i managed to have someone over the phone  and opening a new fault ticket. lack of any type of compensation alternative solutionalso  be warned that virgin has a policy to only give you some credit back if you have a total loss of service for more than 72 hours. if you manage to be connected only one hour per day during this period  they will not compensate you in any form: the customer service department tells you their hands are tied and that you need to ask the technical team to raise a compensation request  but the technical team tells you they have no control over the compensation claims anyway because it's an automatic process. i have been using my 3g data non-stop since the 27th of february  we're the 11th of march and it's still not working  to work from home  but my claims are denied  because apparently there may have been internet an hour or so here and here . if like me  you don't have internet at all  don't even bother asking virgin for some alternative solution  mobile broadband  mobile phone 4g credit  etc...  as they cannot  or won't  help you in any way. complains are ignoredi've raised several complains but the compliance department doesn't even bother calling you back  even though i'm told they will call back within 5 days over the phone . ""escalating"" the issue doesn't even make a difference  expect that someone tells you the compliance department will call you back within 48 hours  but they don't .",1.0

661,worst customer services in the uk. 5 separate calls to cancel service after moving  each call 30-50 minutes on hold  every call cut off. online member centre link to cancel service not working so you have no choice but to call. if you sign up to virgin you will regret it  the only question is when.,2.0

665,our router was damaged by a recent power cut  virgin are doing everything except replacing it. problem is getting worse as wifi no longer works upstairs. it did before. have long thought their customer service was non existant but at least the kit used to work  no longer so. we have 2 people working from home  one a key worker. situation is now so bad i'm thinking about moving even though that will result in much lower speeds.,2.0

669,the service is advertised at 100mbits what you'll mostly get 99% of the time is half that at around 50mbits. yet  the price keeps going up. so  let me get this straight  you provide half the advertised speed and provide non-existent customer service  read the other reviews  yet you're raising prices on people? no thanks. i'm moving on asap to someone else.,1.0
670,"the business side is so bad that after 1 day i wanted to cancel  believe it or not in our days and age they do not support wifi?!!!when i canceled after 1 day they wanted to charge me 90days of service  apparently they do not know the 14 days retractation period...stay away from this service",1.0
671,the broadband itself is fine. terrible customer service. a catalogue of ineptitude and poor behaviour. very long waits to speak to people. passed between many people and having to start the process anew each time. when moving house you need to set up a new account  requiring you to use a new email address. they posted equipment to my old address  but took half a day of calling them to realise that's what they had done. then it turned out the equipment  which they insisted i needed to use   was the same cable i already had. sales staff promised i would be able to continue using the same deal i was already getting  but when i moved virgin claimed there was no note on my file  so i had to start a new contract. they refuse to send email confirmation of the content of calls  so i have no way of proving what they said. attempting to get anything sorted is a painful process of listening to their terrible hold music on repeat for hours. it's maddening.,2.0
672,"virgin media has the worst customer service ever. i regret switching over to them  i have logged complaint few time as my broadband connection keeping dropping and all of the compliants have been closed without anyone even contacting me. i wish i had not moved to them  cant wait until my contract finishes so i can move away from them.",2.0
673,virgin are useless  i have had issues ranging from poor network speed  being unable to use broadband at all for days on end  being lied to by customer services  if i was lucky enough to get through . all in all a terrible experience  avoid at all costs ,2.0
674,when the internet is working at normal speeds throughout the day  there is major packet loss  when playing games  but technically it is the speed that i pay for. any time past about 4 or 5pm the speeds go down to less than 5mbps and nothing that requires internet is useable until the next day. virgin media needs to stop throttling speeds since they are adamant on their website that they do not! it is absoltely disgraceful and it's been going on for over 6 months!,2.0
675,"been a virgin media customer since december 2009. every so often the broadband becomes unstable but nothing has been as bad as the last 2 weeks. i was in a zoom meeting and my son was doing his home learning. we were both kicked out and the wifi disappeared from the list of available networks. i immediately tried to contact virgin on 150 but was on hold for almost an hour after hearing a less than helpful automated message. i eventually got to speak to someone who asked me to unplug my router and plug it back in again after a few minutes. didn't work. tried to call back and couldn't get through. the network eventually appeared in the list but i couldn't access any web addresses or log into my company's vpn. i've been without internet since and was told the ""estimated"" date and time of completion would be 28th january at 10:20am. i had internet from 8am that morning but 2 hours later  the internet had disappeared again. i've contacted customer services again and asked to leave  if the service i'm paying for isn't fixed by the end of the day. i was informed by the leavers team that the fix in the whole of my area will now be fixed by 3rd february. unacceptable. customers are working from home and home schooling their children. any fix should be resolved as quickly as possible and we should be informed of any issues  rather than us having to spend most of our day on the phone to be told nothing useful. i received a letter a few weeks ago stating that my plan was increasing. if my service was faultless  i'd have no problem paying more for my plan.",2.0
676,customer service if you have a problem or every 6 months when they put your bill up is dreadful. you will be spending hours of your life on hold. worst customer service of any of the providers i've been with.,1.0
677,there is an obvious problem with my broadband and tv package which virgin  after several conversations with them  are not prepared to resolve.  they claim out of this world broadband speeds but in reality i find them quite slow for what i pay for the service  almost â£60 ,2.0
678,virgin media customer service are non-existent. i spent over 10 hours across three days trying to contact customer service  their customer service line puts one on hold for 60+ minutes  and then disconnects if one has not yet reached an agent  which rarely occurs . when one does finally reach an agent  s he has no authority to resolve problems  they only transfer to other agents. agents then refuse to admit problems  and instead threaten customers with legal action for breach of contract when they assert that virgin media's services do not work as advertised. prices change without notice  and customer service agents deny that there is any change even when presented with differing bills for the same service. reaching any customer service agent at all required 19 !  posts on virgin media's facebook page  in order to finally arrange a webchat. virgin media are dishonest thieves whose have systems designed to waste so much customer time that the customer gives up and pays whatever they ask. one * for customer service is too much. avoid.,2.0
679,i'm simply disgusted with the service. before i had the 50mbps fibre but i was only getting about 8-9mbps and then i had to pay more to upgrade to the 10mbps package. they did nothing attheor end to try fix my service. their get out jail card is based on you getting 'up to' 50mbps. luckliy by street fibre optics were recently upgraded by the council so i do get more speed now. however  my router needs to be reset 2-3 times a day. i frequently lose connect and have to reboot the router. i have tried to contact virgin  but it is virtually impossible. do not switch to virgin.,2.0
680,virgin media is not fit for purpose.  broadband speed good when hard wired but wireless is intermittent.  customer service is non existent. tv service is a joke. the problems are endless and too may to go into here. we had an engineers visit last year when the system was working  albeit intermittently. but when he left we had no service of anything for 8 days. the next engineer to visit said the first had damaged it. told we would be compensated in june 2020. still waiting.  we were updated to 360 in december 2020. nothing works consistently. engineer visiting tomorrow but will be the last visit they make other than collecting their equipment when i go back to sky.  if your'e thinking of going to virgin media  don't  you will regret it.,1.0
681,i have been with virgin for a couple of years  goes without saying that i have been having problems with them from day one. after several visits from the engineers  it was ascertained that the problem was in the junction box  instead to add new connections they have patched everyone to the existing one not allowing enough speed to go through to all  hence the connection and the speeds keep dropping. apparently  they know this as several neighbours have made a complaint but  instead of fixing the problem  they keep sending people out to see the internal connections which we know there are not the problem. the customer service team is horrendous  and when you want to raise a complaint and you ask what exactly is the engineer coming out to fix again  the supervisors hang up on you  very professional,2.0
682,no customer support for technical faults. facing lot of intermittent connections from 1.5 months. raised a compliant 2 times no response from these people. i do not suggest to go with these people. very unresponsive. for virgin ref: compliant numbers are: c-1101213210 and c-150121924.,2.0
683,virgin media have not kept their word with anything. customer service is zero. terrible. i was promised compensation for no tv or broadband for 6 days. they basically told me tough! i eventually got â£7 credit to my account. the fibre broadband keeps dropping out or just no service. be careful when you sign up. they are very helpful at the start. then it all goes downhill! now they want to put price up by â£3.50 absolutely disgraceful,2.0
684,cancellation nightmare - after seeing great offer for vm broadband i decided to switch  then it began! hub received promptly  best part of the service  but couldnt get it connected so started the tedious time waste of trying to get to talk to anyone over phone or their cs text service for 2 days who might help.  next day determined to now cancel this altogether finally got someone after over hours wait and politely asked them to cancel  but guy on phone obviously drilled on trying to keep you  i said over and over again that i had changed my mind and just want to return hub but he waant having any of it  and after confirming my details the call went dead.. i presumed this had been cancelled but then started getting emails and texts welcoming me to vm and and comfirming i am now connected! i replied to every message saying i am not commected and have canceäºled the switch but this has just continued for a week with my texting and leaving messages to them saying i am not with vm and have cancelled. but  when approaching another provider have been told cannot switch to them as am with vm and they have to  cancel something on their system before i can go elsewhere.  more phone caäºls not answered. only 1 of their cs text team seemed to have any idea what was happening but umfortumately told me she was unable to resolve it...but did say my accoumt at that time had not been canceäºled and was active.  to cut a long story short i have stayed with my current provided who have now offered me a great deal and having explained the issues i hipe have managed to cancel everything  but incase they havnt  as not yet have had any comfirmatiom of cancellatiom from vm  i have made sure no money can be taken by them from my account.,2.0
685,"crooks!!avoid! broadband speeds and reliability are ok  but if you decide to cancel their service after your contract with them expires is a complete nightmare. first  once you select ""if you are thinking of leaving us"" option on the phone  they put you on a queue  i've waited for up to an hour on occasions and the line randomly hangs up while you are in the queue. if you are lucky enough to get to a customer service representative  they'll try and give you a crap new deal  if you refuse  they'll ""transfer"" you to a colleague and then the big old wait is on and it will randomly hang up again. i've wasted 3 days trying to cancel my service with virgin and still haven't...oh  and once they kick you out of the waiting queue  you can't call again for a few hours  they put you in a ban list or something  complete crooks!!",2.0

687,"don't be tempted by the initial offer!i have been with virgin media for around 7 years at 3 different properties. when i moved from my 1st to 2nd property i had no issues and the transfer was smooth but it all went down hill from there with them trying to hike prices at least twice a year mid contract. every time i had to phone to contest taking 2 or 3 phone calls of anything up to an hour. when me and my partner separated i could not move my account with me and had to set up a new one at my new address. virgin messed up all the passwords so i could not access either account for nearly 3 weeks with multiple phone calls. had to do a transfer of contract responsibility to my ex so she could take over the bill but they couldn't even get that right after 5 attempts via phone and post. got that frustrated i just cancelled the account and she had to open a new one in her name. messed up my passwords and email again and they tried to close both accounts saying that i owed them and early exit fee. once i got all of this sorted towards the end of my contract an offer came up online on my personal account where i could add the tv and faster broadband to my package for a total of â£37 a month. should have known better than to try and upgrade!received email confirmation of price and package details direct from virgin media and my new tivo box arrived later that week. set it all up and within a week got my first bill which was over â£22 more a month than quoted. here we go again! 42 minute phone call with no result and the promise of a call back from a manager the next day. no call back. another 47 minute call where i emailed the proof of the price while they were still on the line to the email address they were spelling out for me  only to be told they couldn't access that email and a manager would call me back in 24 hours. nobody called me back. another 75 minute phone call speaking to 4 different people and they finally reduced it to.......â£37.50 and i was told this was the closest they could get the package. these phone calls were the ones when i actually spoke to somebody after multiple times of being on hold for 20 to 30 minutes and then them hanging up.after taking a tv package i realised how little there was to watch on virgin as you have to pay for the larger bundles if you want any of the sky channels and a large percentage of what is available on freeview for nothing. this contract ended on the 28th of december so virgin decided they now want to charge me â£59 a month for the privilege of rubbish tv  a landline i have never used and averagely performing broadband. a few days later an email also informs me they are putting their prices up a further â£3.50 as well! i phoned them thinking i will be able to haggle and get a cheap deal as usual but not this time. the cheapest they would do broadband on its own was â£37 while new customers were getting it at â£28 so i have cancelled finally. oh and if you are late paying your bill they will phone you 2 or 3 times a day without fail until its paid but you cant contact them most of the time if you have a problem.if you have got to the bottom of this review i strongly urge you not to give virgin media your custom as they are rip off merchants of the highest order and their customer service is non-existent.",2.0

691,i have been with virgin fibre broadband for over 3 years  i have the m200 broadband package which claims to have an average download speed of 213 mbs  i have tested this multiple times throughout those 3 years and the highest i ever got was 50 mbps and a 10 mbps upload speed and this was on a lan connection  the wifi was more in the region of 35 mbps. i pay â£50 a month for this and they have just told me they are increasing the price by â£3.50. they should be refunding for the speeds i am paying for and never getting. i only stay with them because other suppliers do not have fibre in my area and offer only 10 mbps download speeds. as soon as they do offer fibre  i am leaving. it is disgraceful they are allowed to falsely claim you can expect those download speeds. the truth is you will get no where near them. absolute con. fibre broadband is much cheaper with other providers and they don't claim download speeds that are way way above what you actually get.,1.0
692,absolute joke  after waiting for almost an hour i get through  i complain about the recent email announcing that an increase is on the way  â£3.50 ..my package consisted of  just tv landline and broadband  and i was paying around the â£50 per month mark.the woman at the end of the phone up helled the price rise stating that vm was due to put the price up last year but due to the covid 19 they  held back  how saintly  i raised the point that what the difference now from then ie we still have covid and are in full lockdown and in a worse place financially than last year.she replied that its because of the govmt they tell vm to increase the price   thinking i must sound stupid on the phone  i said that the gvmt would never tell a company to increase their prices and enlightened her about free enterprise and how the gvmt actually encourage competition that's why you have the monopolies commission etc  she then said 'its the vat ..the tax when they put it up'thats what it is  there is a bit of dunning- krugar syndrome going on with this woman  i said tax  vat are at 20 per cent  they haven't been changed and if they do it will be announced in april normally   not march  unless you are psychic. i ask for a cheaper price    she trys to give me a slight discount but its a sneeky one as it wont last as long as the whole contract   just 6 months   i ask to take away the tv cha that i don't watch and the landline that i don't use   she says her screen has grayed out on that box   she cant help me   but will transfer me to someone else .half hour later i speak to an asian man who takes me through all the sec procedures again   i tell him my problem i he starts to speak fast and on hands free i can only make out the odd word  another transfer  another wait  another taken through security  i say b4 i talk do u have the authority to do what i ask   he says what is it   i tell him give me a price without tv and phone   he quotes me â£40. i said is that for 100 mps he said yes   i then asked for 60mps  he quoted â£34 permonth   i said looking at that its dear to other companies  i said i give you 1months notice ..after looking around  and being 60 and all the different routers and cables become confusing so i bottled out. i ring up vm again to reverse the cancellation  i get through after 30 mins to a young asian woman who asked me my name    address and postcode   i had to spell out my name  then she asks postcode  and house number and turns round and says that my name does not match up with that address  so we go through the landline tel number and i get put on hold for 10 mins  she comes back and says how can i help   i say do you have my details now on screen she says yes  and then we go through security procedure ...again!..i tell her my story and ask her what s the best deal for the old package  i had but with slower broadband   she says she cant downgrade  any package and puts me through to another agent   30 mins later i speak to another agent and i say to her is she the right person to do the biz  so i don't waste time   she says she is and i ask her to look at my bundle and if she can do anything as i might reconsider leaving at this point i'm scheduled for termination 8th feb she says she can bring it down a little more   and after that being squeezed out of her i then asked for the price if my speed was reduced to 60 mps  she relied  wait for it!!  that due to how the bundles are packaged  it will be more expensive ????. i said then by your reckoning and logic if i upgrade my package one by adding things on   my monthly payments should reduced  is that correct i asked? she replied i know what your implying and how it sounds  but it just is  ..i think its a wall to keep the price high. i asked is that the very best she could  do and she said yes   so i said okay we will roll with that....i then hang up the landline phone from her and as i do my mobile rang  i then here the dulcet tones of a mature peoples person old school saleman on the mobile   telling me how sorry  vm that i'm leaving   he tell s me i'm a vip and the length of time i v been with them how wud i like to have my tv channels ..+ 2 others thrown in   your landline ...and 100 mps broadband for just â£29 per month.. isaid yes please   i asked about his authority  and he informed me that he is higher up the ladder then cust serv by quite a few rungs   so i  say so therefore you have the ability to overule any decision by cust serv and any deal they make you can trump it  is that correct ? he assures me   i said okay that's fine send me an email with the new revised contract...so the next day i get an email from vm and its the contract for â£44.30 permonth not â£29.00.. so because he used a vm  mobile i sent a message to him saying i haven't seen your email yet is everything ok  i didn't get an answer..most likely wont do. but i cant pay â£44 to them  now after having a deal for â£29... so i will have to cancel the contract again and do it in writing to head office .. recorded del!! not falling for that one   as i have 14 days cool off period. in the letter  i mention my disappointment on not honouring the deal the offered me ..anyway if i don't hear from them  then i have to let things take their  course and find i new provider,2.0

700,i bought virgin 200 and occasionally that speed happens. for a short while. on a daily basis there are times when we have no internet. i continually check the speed and the average is about 20 mobs though many times only in single figures. at times our tv has to buffer  and also on important zoom calls. many months ago i held on for ages to speak to someone who said a new router would fix all which i doubted  and after reinstall and changing all internet passwords  around the house  alexa etc  it made no difference at all. i gave up holding on and on many times. eventually wrote to the ceo in sunderland but 'he was on holiday' beyond words awful. actually stressful. online info states restart router. that's an almost daily duty. awful. problem is no other high speed in our area as yet so still have to hang on though out of contract and paying a lot extra because of that  but i have champagne cooling for the day i can leave.,2.0

709,"virgin review virgin media - possibly the single worst internet provider i have ever dealt with. apologies  this is a long review  but i beg you read it. they installed fibre optic into our building  promised tenants superior service enticing a bunch of us to move away from our slower  but stable providers.  after 2 months of problems  17 customer service calls  and 5 engineers coming to the building  i've had enough.  1  first  when they surveyed the building they failed to check the building wires properly. whilst it is a new build  every apartment in the building is fitting with air filled cables. apparently these are not fit for use with virgin media equipment  i am not an electrician network specialist - i am repeating what the last virgin media senior engineer told me . for me this hasn't been a problem  testing the cable shows a good connection but for others in the building it has meant they've switched to virgin and they are completely unable to connect  air filled cable twisted and shorting out the circuit .  had they of properly surveyed the building  they would have realised this. 2  secondly  whilst my connection is fine i was still running into significant downtime. the 4th engineer that came to the property reviewed the fibre centre in the risers of the building to discover that the virgin installation team had failed to plug the connections in properly. meaning that whilst i had a connection  it was only to 1 out of the 4 available network centres. when that centre went down  the building was unable to fail over to any of the other 3 available.  amazing. couldn't make this incompetence up. 3  even now when i am connected to all 4 network centres  virgin has constant network issues. i have been without a stable connection for the whole of the christmas period. i am writing this whilst hot-spotting from my mobile.  4  when i am actually connected to the internet i am on the 200mbps package with a guaranteed minimum of around 100mbps - i'd be so lucky. in the 2 months i've been with these jokes  i have at the most 80mbps but recently its been more like 20-30mbps. whilst this is plenty for most people  my use case is somewhat unique  especially whilst working from home. my point is  don't bother paying a premium for virgin thinking you'll get crazy speeds. you won't. .. don't worry. my complaints don't stop here. 5  i have called approximately 17 times since november 7th to explain the issues. every time you call  don't expect to be on hold for anything less than 40 minutes before getting to speak with an agent. certainly don't expect a resolution. after the 10th time i requested to speak with a manager. i've never once been put straight through - its always ""we promise a call back"". nope. i have been promised a call back by a manager 5 times and only on one occasion has that actually happened. 6  i have asked them for an interim fix for whilst they try fix the network issues  of course  they are unable to tell me what the network issue is . i have suggested a wifi dongle for when the service is down. nope.  7  i've been charged â£70 for the privilege of dealing with these clowns so far. their customer service agents don't care about your issue. they don't want to help or find a resolution. they can't tell you what the issues are.  i made the mistake of not looking on here before i went with virgin. i cannot convey strongly enough how diabolical they are. i am currently collecting evidence to provide to the ombudsman  speaking with the building management  that manage all the apartments blocks in my area - paddington  to get virgin removed from the building and prevent them from falsely advertising their services in all their buildings  and i am speaking with a friend at hyper optic hoping he will be able to help get them installed instead.",2.0

744,"i would welcome anyone's views on the grievances outlined in a letter of complaint i sent off by email today. i have now noticed that since sending the letter off  the speed has considerably dropped.  it might be worth mentioning also my yearly contract had finished back in september. i had only been paying 29 sterling as a special promotion for 100mbps when i initially signed up.  by telephone  i attempted to renew the contract and at first i was offered the same packet but for 59 sterling.  i refused to accept it and hung up. but didn't give up and rang again.  but i didn't give up.  by some sort of fluke i managed to get through to marianne at customer retention.  she offered me something completely different for 28 sterling but the same packet for the same speed.  i asked her how so  since i was originally quoted a different price.  she said  in future  just ask to be put through to customer retention.  what is this?  there is no option for customer retention when you make a call.  press 1 2 3  4 for limited options no mention of customer retention.  after reading all the reviews of people in similar circumstances  i thought it was worth a mention.  only after reading other reviews of people being encouraged to accept the initial quote did it ring a bell.  getting back to my grievances over the last 2 days  here is the letter:- please note that my reference to being a 'satisfied customer' was in regards to the high speed only.  this was why i signed up in the first place.     to whom it may concern   i have been a customer with virgin media since october 2019 and in that time  i have been more than satisfied with the quality of services provided.  a situation has now arisen in the past two days that requires me to move to another home.  consequently  i decided to act right away in an attempt to transfer my account to the new address. the address was in the same town  not far from the present address.  by doä±ng this  i had no inclination ä±t would turn out to be a problem lä±ke the one that unfolded. yesterday  i went online to check if your services were available at the new address. i entered the postcode several times on the facility provided via my online account. however  there was an instruction 'please wait' each time i entered. i assumed that maybe this was because there were lots of apartments in the building. subsequently  i proceeded to enter the online chat facility under 'moving home' to get further clarification on the issue. from the outset of the chat  i specifically outlined the nature of my enquiry ie i would be moving home and i wanted to find out if virgin media was available in that area:  and  that my previous attempts to enter the postcode had been unsuccessful. this was not clarified immediately by the agent but instead  he proceeded to ask for security details and lots of information relating to the new address. he also asked if i wanted virgin media at the new address to which i replied 'i did'.  since this turned out to be a lengthy procedure  i interpreted it as meaning that the service was indeed available at the new address   after all i had not been advised otherwise. or  indeed my interpretation was that i needed to go through this procedure just to find out if services were  in fact available in the area. the correspondence ended with the agent advising me that another agent would be in touch in the next 45 minutes. in the meantime  i decided to call virgin media for further clarification.  i explained what had happened as outlined above.  the agent advised that it was an unnecessary procedure and there should have been a check beforehand to establish if the service was available at said location. he then kindly proceeded to check this out and was able to confirm that it wasn't in fact  available. he also advised there would be a fee for disconnection. i was disappointed when i heard this and the agent was sympathetic to my concerns.  he was very helpful and kindly offered to transfer me to customer care which i accepted. i waited for 20 minutes but there was no reply. despite this  i continued to the chat facility in the hope that maybe there would be some other options available.  before i could get to explain what had happened  the agent took me through the whole process again asking for lots of information. in between times  i asked if he could see the messages from the first point of contact where i had already given all the same information.  as time went on  i became increasingly frustrated and the conversation was just one of disarray and confusion. at the end of it  he said the service was indeed not available and that there would be a fee for disconnection.  then he encouraged me to book a cancellation date. my account of the correspondence  leads me to my poä±nt in writing to you.  my grievance is twofold: 1    i can only describe yesterday's communication as a mission impossible.  for at least four hours  i was trying to clarify something that could have been clarified at the outset.  in addition  there was no consistency in the means of communication  at least not what one would expect from a high profile service provider.  it provided nothing but unnecessary confusion for such a simple inquiry.  of course with exception to the agent's help via telephone call. my hope is that in highlighting the matter  you may take it on board and review it for whatever purposes. 2   the above  coupled with the fact that i was alarmed to learn that i would have to pay a disconnection fee.  this  i find totally incomprehensible.  taking into consideration the fact that i did not wish to leave virgin media  in the first place and that your broadband service was not available for that location. it was not a matter of me being dissatisfied with your services.  why  therefore should i be penalised for something that is totally out of my control? when i renewed my contract back in september  i could not foresee that i would be moving home in the future. it came about out of necessity. just like i could not foresee the service would not be available at the new address.  the terms of the contract do not allow for such a predicament.  in other words  when i agreed to that contract  i did so  because i was happy with the service after one year's subscription. i never perceived that i would leave it  no matter what the circumstances. i could understand it would be different if it had been a situation whereby i had chosen to leave the service as a dissatisfied customer.  indeed  i would accept  via the terms of the contract  i was liable to pay a disconnection fee.  this however is not the case. furthermore  i am a single parent who is really struggling to make ends meet under the benefits system at this period of time.  the internet connection is a valuable lifeline for me and my child. in that respect  no matter how a little money i receive every month  i have always made it a priority when it comes to paying the essential bills. thereby a loyal customer.  i would also add that even if i was of affluent status  the principle of the matter outlined above would still remain the same. now  i find myself in a situation whereby i must move to another home which incurs further costs.  perhaps you can understand  that such a fee on top of that  i would struggle to pay  and simply have not got the funds to do so. in light of these circumstances and for the reasons aforementioned  i would appeal to you to consider a waiver of the penalty fee. trusting you will acknowledge. i am enclosing a record of yesterday's correspondence for reference.  so the above letter outlined my grievances.  i again decided to contact them out of sheer frustration  not wanting to let it go  this time   after waiting 30 minutes for a response and paying for the call  i asked what the options where. this individual advised that when i pay the diconnection fee and hook up with another provider  that provider will cover the cost of the fee as part of their payment plan.  now  i ask all of you out there.  have you ever heard anything the likes of?????  he's on the other side of a phone call and he thinks i was born yesterday!!!! honestly as we say too good to be true.  wish it were that simple! i then asked if there was any way of airing the complaint since the address i sent the mail off to was the only address i could find  after much deliberation on google search .  there was no facility on their online system for making a complaint.  he further advised me to make the issues known on twitter and facebook.  really  can i trust this? really folks  should customer care not be of utmost priority?  they are virgin media and invincible because of their good reviews for high speeds.  was that not a ploy to get the customers in the initial stages.  why have so many perople mentioned that speeds have been reduced.  how can the customer have faith?  like a lamb to the slaughter. i rest my case. feedback welcome.",1.0

746,abysmal service and disgusting behaviour. virginmedia have a clear policy of providing no support to residential accounts and will block your attempts to obtain any help by automatically directing calls corresponding to your account to a recorded voice message giving false information. if you eventually get a chat response  they will just lie to you  saying that it is a planned outage  for your benefit  and will be restored by a certain future time. it never is  of course. if you use virginmedia broadband  expect much lower average speeds than claimed and the complete loss of service for weeks or even months at a time.,1.0

794,"after a year with virgin i can tell you: do not!* the router provided has very weak wifi signal* even using a cable connection to the router  the speeds are appalling! i bought into 100mbps and my download is somewhere around 30mb and sometimes in the single digits...* reaching these guys is impossible. no email or chat  so you have to hang high and dry on the phone for hours* the final touch: when i called today to ask not to renew my contract  6-oct-2020  10:06 : she started blaming my house  the websites i access... i am an engineer of 20 years now but the person from billing knows better!then she offered me a discount - i told her it's actually a negative that they didn't give me their best price until i threatened to leave. she offered a further 5 quid discount :d :d :d i wouldn't take it for free at this point!",2.0
795,i had the misfortune to be a virgin customer for many years and spent thousands of pounds on there products  however due to ill health and family bereavements i never used any for months and tried unsuccessfully to downgrade and when i did they made me sign a new agreement which under surest through stress i did but they where still trying to fleece me so when my mum died i tried to cancel and the fee they are asking for is nearly a years money i feel depressed over this virgin are crooks plain and simple and i am going to spend months letting the whole world know,1.0
796,useless customer service. i called and agreed on a new deal for my broadband but then when called again to confirm it was made incredibly difficult for me to confirm because they seemed to think that the deal i had been offered was too cheap and i had been offered it wrongly. however rather than simply telling me i couldn't have the deal anymore  i was led to believe that the extra discount had to be a special type that wouldn't appear in the automated email correspondence. this caused me to be locked in to a deal far more expensive than i had originally agreed to. now it is up for debate as to whether i should have believed their rubbish about a special managers discount  however the very fact that they attempted to mislead a customer in order to lock them in to a more expensive deal is utterly outrageous. as soon as my bad value deal with virgin has ended i shall be leaving and taking my business elsewhere.,1.0

845,"until july of this year  virgin media broadband was a reliable service. however  there was a period throughout most of july in which there were regular outages  not only for us  but also generally in the local area.  we have discussed this extensively on facebook.   when i managed to speak by telephone to someone at vm  i was told that they had identified a fault locally on 7 july which would involve intermittent  meaning there would be no financial compensation!  losses of signal until 24 july.  this sounds like quite a fault if it would take 17 days to address.  apparently  others locally have spoken to vm by telephone and have received various possible explanations of the losses  indicating that the customer service people don't have a clue of what exactly is going on! a loss of service occurred again on 3 august  then again on 16  17  18 august.  it seems that there is now likely to be a regular series of such 'intermittent' faults.the same thing has happened twice already today. i have now written to vm complaints in sunderland three times  the first on 24 july.  none of my letters have been replied to! not only is this a disturbingly regular loss of internet service from vm  especially when i rely on the service for external security camera recordings  telephone and fire stick tv reception  as well as general computer access to the internet  but their customer service is absolutely appalling. as vm are failing to respond to my written requests for information  i may be obliged to contact ofcom for further advice. vm seem concerned more about boasting of their high speeds  100 mbs here  but 50 mbs would suit me   yet failing to supply a reliable service. finally  i look forward to the possibility that a different company may eventually offer a competing fibre service in this area  as i would certainly move to that company.  in fact  i'm sure they would make a killing around here.",2.0
846,an absolute joke of a company. as new customers we were exploited by the companies incompetence. our installation was pushed back by 4 weeks  1 week after 2 weeks of waiting  then a further 3 before we cancelled. after asking numerous times about the issue  we were given the vague reply of 'technical difficulty' and it took speaking to 5 different members of staff before we got an answer. they continued to pass us onto other members of staff in the hope we would give up and not cancel. the texting service is also very unreliable and the staff are extremely unhelpful. i have 0 intentions of ever getting a service from virgin media now and will discourage friends and family from choosing them over literally anybody else in the future.,1.0

897,broadband download speeds have never been close to those claimed. a virgin engineer has stood by my router with an instrument demonstrating a speed 10 times faster than i was experiencing with my laptop. he blamed my laptop of course. after years of expensive bills  low speeds and patchy service i have switched to zen internet who have so far provided a faultless service with efficiency  care and courtesy  at half the cost. the final straw with virgin on the ridiculous has been that  after having taken 5 months to respond to my claim for loss of service for 7 days in february  they have made an offer of â£15. their own terms and conditions say they should pay â£8 per day. do yourself a favour and avoid them.,2.0

900,it's over 2 weeks now since our broadband problems began with virgin media  we still have a couple of weeks to run until our 30 days notice expires. the broadband is  working intermittently with constant slow connection or complete loss of service. something has gone seriously wrong at virgin media as they now seem incapable of repairing their equipment.  we broadband works briefly & very slowly  the router loses the white light & all the greens start flashing  you expect this when setting up but not dozens of times every day.,2.0
901,i have been with them for a couple of years and at the beginning everything was fine competitively priced until the renewal of contract! i contacted their customer services several weeks before as i told them the contract ran out 13 april 2020  but everytime i rang they said there was no alternative deals to be had ! yet blatantly advertising on t.v. radio  and on my phone deals as low as â£25.00 pcm they flatly refused to make any deal under â£41.00  as i did have  it on dd but never again !!! they were adamant that  that is what it had to be despite that being for the basic package and i am a pensioner the cheeky bastards even tried to take this amount and kept saying that price offered was already reduced from â£59.00 they are having a laugh!!! i got rid of sky for the same reason i wrote to them twice and also tried to contact them on three phone numbers but they all lead to billing even the 0800 number their only interested in demanding high increases every year for existing companies and for the majority of the programmes are freeview anyway so its a right con! i don't have t.v anymore i've just got bb now and cancelled my t.v licence so to sum up crap customer service  not interested in existing customers! take months to reply! and phoning is pointless  you can't reply to their emails  i wonder why! basically wouldn't touch them with a barge pole,2.0

941,"i would give no stars but not sure if i can -? actually minus stars! join virgin media:-if you have literally nothing to do and enjoy endless hours waiting to speak to customer services and then getting repeatedly cut off after your 55 minute waits  rack up 60+ hours of calls over 9 months trying to resolve a few things virgin should never have done e.g. charging you for a tv package you cancelled 8 months prior -when you promptly returned the tv box to them 8 months earlier and acknowledged receipt of it. this has been going on since mid 2019 and now june 2020 so way before the pandemic before that is used as an excuse! -if you enjoy being sent from department to department since no-one can resolve simple issues  hours and hours wasted  calls are routinely disconnected after long waits and if they repeatedly promise you that a manager will call you back -know that they wonât! -if you enjoy being overcharged for all sorts of thing.-if you enjoy being put on a overpriced broadband contract  almost double the offers they have online  which you never agreed to after your last contract ended and you repeatedly told them you didnât want to be on a new contract  which they agreed to  but would only be on a rolling one until they resolved the issues  which it took them 8 months to do ! they agreed one price for the rolling contract but charged â£12 extra  month and refused to refund it or listen to their recorded calls. as an extra bonus they will charge you another â£40 set up fee for the 2nd new overpriced contract that you never agreed to and will refuse to refund this illegal set up fee.-if you enjoy a dodgy service  when i had the tv box it only worked 40-50% of the time so i ended up just not watching it as iâd have to call virgin each time and it was too painful. the internet is fine  where i am in central london  canât speak for elsewhere  but several issues even with that. iâm assuming that most would disagree re the internet being fine as the whatsapp group for my area -300+ people- are always complaining about virginâs internet.-etc. i could literally carry on with numerous other examples but have wasted too much time already. literally feel like i've been tortured by virgin media as they messed up so many things and one issue took 8 months and about 60 hours of me calling and still not resolved -promised calls back by managers i never got  could never get through  etc. so painful. iâve just paid them their illegal charges to be rid of them and to cancel the contract but will write a more detailed report for the communication and internet adjudication scheme  cisas  -virgin is not signed up with the main ombusman services so cisas is who you contact if you if have an issue with virgin. will be several months quicker than trying to get virgin media to resolve it! avoid virgin if you can!",2.0

1143,"copy of my complaint email to virgin ceo lutz schueler: dear mr shueler  i am writing this email whilst on hold with your customer service team  41 minutes in at this point  being passed from customer service to cancellations and back.... i have been a customer of virgin for over 15 years and have had enough over the last month with my broadband not working properly. after giving virgin over 9 attempts to resolve the issue i have now decided to cancel the contract as i cannot afford to be taking time off for your engineers to visit and being late for work whilst trying to resolve the issues. not to mention the many hours spent on the phone with your customer service  wasting my evenings and weekends. 1 hour 3 minutes on the phone with customer service & counting..... i have now been told that i will have to pay a penalty as i am contracted to virgin until february 2020... this after paying you for a service that you were unable to provide. i am sure that under my consumer rights i should not be penalised for cancellation of a service that you did not provide adequately. oh  i have just been advised that customer service closes   9pm and that someone will call me tomorrow. over an hour on the phone...wow! this attempt to play hardball with customers and pressure  force them to keep parting with their money for an inferior  sometimes non existent service will only lead to virgin media gradually losing total confidence from their customers and as you well know bad reviews travel much wider than good ones. one of the issues that pushed me over the edge  was virgin's total disregard for their customers time  offering a discount of â£32  for not providing adequate service for a month impacting on homework  coursework  working from home and general tasks which are all very dependent on having an internet connection. in addition the 2 days off work for engineers visits  being late for work and a wild guess of 10's of hours wasted on the phone with customer service - at least it felt that long. plus penalty clauses for termination of a service not received as paid for. i would like to think that a reputable company the size of virgin respects and treats their loyal customers fairly  which is why i have gone to the principal directly with this predicament. normally large organisations take their lead from the top and are the mirror image of their leaders. i would like you to intervene  contact your cancellation team  to advise them that they are entitled to only 3 attempts to resolve the issues - let alone 9 attempts  before they are obliged to accept my termination of the contract without any further penalty charges applying. on another note  i have been contemplating moving all 4 of our mobile telephone contracts to virgin mobile  actually moved the 1st one just last weekend - which i am now thinking was a mistake and maybe i should utilise the 14 day return  cancellation period. all of virgin media should be very careful how they treat their customers as there may be knock on consequences if consumers feel that they are taken for granted. customers are easily lost but very difficult to then regain their trust. i will await your response for the next 7 days  until thursday 24th october 2019  after which i will be forced to make a formal complaint to ofcom and request their recommendations on my consumer rights relating to this complaint. i most sincerely hope that you will respond to this complaint and use it to try to improve virgin media's service provided to it's customers  as well as change my current impression of the company  too big to care about their customers views.  best regards *the response*: we would like to thank you for taking the time to contact us today. we are very sorry to hear that you are unhappy and we will endeavour to resolve your issues as soon as possible. lutz is currently not available to deal with your complaint personally  however we have passed your email onto a member of his team  and they will be in touch with you as soon as possible in order to assist you with your queries. we look forward to discussing this matter with you in the future. kind regards  roopa murugan on behalf of lutz schuler.  nearly 4 weeks have passed  nothing more from the ceo's office  i do wonder where this disdain for customers comes from  from the top maybe?  i then had this emailed to me: get the bigger bundle with m200 fibre broadband for â£49 a month  if you stay.. show images  hello nik we're really sorry to hear you want to leave virgin media.before you go  there's this exclusive deal we're hoping can change your mind.  if you stay with us for another 12 months  we'd like to give you the bigger bundle with maxit tv  m200 fibre broadband and inclusive weekend calls to uk landlines  for just â£49 a month for a whole year.ë then standard pricing  currently â£83  after that.keep enjoying more of the good stuff  for lesswith this exclusive offer  you'll get:  m200 fibre broadband with an average download speed of 213mbpsâ  over 230 channels all the action on bt sport  including selected premier league and uefa champions league in 4k on bt sport 4k uhd* with european rugby loads of incredible channels in glorious hdtons of brilliant tv box sets and virgin tv exclusivesplus  talk weekends  which includes weekend calls to uk landlines  virgin mobiles and 0870 numbersï«all for just â£49 a month for 12 months if you decide to keep your virgin media services. does this tempt you a little?  my response: i clicked on the link and accepted their offer to stay  idi0t!!!!!!!  their confirmation of my new contract: hi nik  thanks for making those changes to your virgin media package. you won't need to sign a new contract. quick recap of what you now enjoy: your new package now includes: tv: maxit tvbroadband: discount - m100 fibre broadbandwe've removed: tv: full house tv  xl broadband: m200 fibre broadband here's how your changes affect your next bill: your next bill will be generated on 27th november 2019your next payment is due on 12th december 2019 your new monthly bundle cost is: â£56.75*. your next bill will be â£45.04* which includes cr â£11.71 to cover your changes up until your next bill period. there is also a one-off charge of 0.00 for installation or activation.  we've attached a receipt will full details of your new package  plus all the details of costs. if you have any questions about your bill  please visit my virgin media. kind regards  the virgin media team   so to recap: they offered â£49 per month + m200 broadband in their email and when i clicked on the link to accept that i then got a confirmation of â£56 per month + m100 broadband  this to try to convince me to stay  hahahah. when i contacted them to ask why the difference in offer to confirmation they told me they couldn't change anything and that i would have to send them proof of the offer. i have to prove what they sent me in a an email  i still can't believe it whilst writing this. i then advised them that i want to cancel that change in contract and revert back to my cancellation date of 16 11 as they did not supply the contract that they originally offered. they had the cheek to say that i have to give them 30 days notice and pay penalties. i have advised them that i will only pay for my services until the 16 11  the cancelation date agreed without penalties before they tricked me into extending the contract. i will cancel my direct debit and they can take me to court to explain to a judge how they tried to con me. *** beware of virgin media _ customer service is a shambles_you get passed from india to scotland to india to scotland...â¦...don't say i didn't warn you***",1.0

1189,"virgin media' service in general is quite simply appalling. 1. customer service. i have contacted virgin media a few times since having their broadband installed at home. on each occasion they have been difficult to get through to the correct department they have had a lack of understanding and a lack of general care. it genuinely feels like virgin employ people straight off the street who couldn't care less about customers. 2. billing i have no idea what kind of system virgin run on but it's heavily flawed and completely ridiculous. after a separation from my wife she took the phone number and moved it to another provider.because i had removed the phone from the service my bill changed from â£45 per month to â£67. where is the logic in that? i then cancelled the service all together and my final bill was over â£100 instead of â£40 50.i then had a message to contact virgin where they told me they had made an error with the billing and would recalculate it while i was on the phone. they reduced the bill from over â£100 to â£36.i honestly believe if i had not called i would have still had an incorrect final bill. 3. complaints a complete joke. 2 complaints raised and no responses. 4. fastest internet! no! it's not  it has loads of crappy latency and fluctuates so much. i have found plusnet vdsl more responsive and more reliable.with virgin i had to reboot the router at least once a week. conclusion: virgin media are another large company who only care about money and not the people or the product.their call centres primarily consist of people who do not understand english as their first language. their prices are ridiculous and billing systems are pathetic. if your reading this and consider virgin as a provider  don't waste your money on supporting this abysmal company.",2.0

1200,"virgin claim to provide fast broadband  not fast  or reasonable  service! i feel my recent experience with virgin media does not even deserve 1 star. backgroundi wanted to save some money  so i contacted virgin media to find out what was the best price they could offer me. they were advertising a great deal for new customers. i had been with virgin for 10 years and was told that new customer offer was only available once per household. despite me telling virgin media that i was unemployed and was looking for ways to reduce my monthly outgoings  i was twice offered a new deal that would be more than i was already paying. a clear indication that they were not listening to me. i re-requested that they give me their best deal. the âbestâ they could do was nearly double the new customer offer i mentioned earlier. i declined their offers and said i would be looking for an alternative provider. i was out of contract and was free to leave. âgoodâ dealsi did some research and found what looked like a fairly good deal with plusnet. contacted plusnet  i accepted their deal and agreed an installation date. i called virgin media back to confirm that i wanted to leave. after trying again to sell me a new âbetterâ deal and then realising they couldnât come close to the price from plusnet. i told them i wanted my phone number transferred to the new service provider and a member of the virgin media team talked me through the service termination and phone number export process. i agreed to their âminimum 30-dayâ termination clause  making my last day with virgin media day 13 september. i was told by virgin media that only live phone numbers can be exported  so they would leave my phone service as active until after the export had completed. the other services  tv and broadband  would be set to end on 13 september as agreed. i new service was due to go live with plusnet on 11 september  so this date seemed to provide a good overlap  in case there were any hiccups. hiccupson 29 august  my broadband and tv service stopped working. i called virgin media to ask for help. i was told that my service was terminated âas agreedâ  when plusnet issues the phone number export request on 29 august. i said that was not what i agreed and was told  but virgin insisted that there was nothing they could do to turn my tv and broadband services back on until the previously agreed date of 13 september. virgin suggested i ask plusnet if they could bring the installation date forward. i called plusnet and was told they could not move the date forward  as there were not free slots before 11 september. i called virgin back and spoke to a more friendly individual  who did some research and said she could request a reconnection  she would need to fill in some forms and it would take up to 72 hours. 72 hourscan and went  still not service  another called to virgin media  another unhelpful team member. the only option to get the service back is to if i âcancel the export and revert back to virgin mediaâ as my service provider. if i do that  i get my service back in around 3 days  but i will lose my phone number  forever. i decide not to do this and the issue to be escalated. âit wonât helpâ to escalate my issue iâm told by the virgin media team member. i ask to speak with her supervisor. no that canât be done either. i ask for a formal complaint to be raised. in a later phone call  i am told that a virgin media team member in the âexport teamâ made the mistake that caused my service to be terminated 14 days earlier than agreed. no responsestill heard nothing about anything except a few curt  apparently automated  emails telling me to send back their equipment or i will be charged. i sent back all their equipment 13 days prior to the most recent demanding email  so i call virgin media again  to be told âwe know the equipment is on its wayâ  but the system takes 10 working days to notify them of this. i suggest they should change the tone of their emails if the biggest delay in the process is caused by their internal system communication. i was treated like it was my fault that a virgin media internal system takes 10 days to notify another virgin media team. and virgin media isnât responsible if an automated email causes upset. if an email sent by virgin media to a virgin media customer causes upset  whose fault it then? it must be my fault  i mean i am the customer. based on my previous experience this should have been obvious  my mistake. 45 daysmoving on to more pleasant things then  the virgin media team member iâm speaking with tells me my refund cheque with me mailed to me within the next 45 days. i ask for clarification  âdid you say 4 to 5 days?â the reply was a definite âno  45 daysâ. forty-five days to send me a refund cheque. what the ****? they have to be kidding me  right? no  it turns out iâm silly for thinking otherwise. apparently  45 days is normal and acceptable. the only thingthe only thing that takes longer than the time virgin media take to respond to complaints is how long it will take them to send a refund! this is not actually true  as i havenât received any communication from virgin media about my complaint yet  so donât know how long i will have to wait for that  but i wonât be at all surprised if itâs longer than 45 days!",2.0

1406,i am so upset with how i have been treated by virgin media customer service. i called virgin media in november to cancel my contract as i thought the price was too high and the speed was not satisfactory. i was connected to the cancellations departament  the guy was quite friendly and told me that it was a sales tactic that they use  they put the prices up after 12 months of you being their customer and you have to call them every year in order to negotiate in order for them to lower your price. so basically we are all getting ripped off. he also recommended that i get a new broadband with my current one being over 2 years old and the difference of the speed of my internet will be like ânight and dayâ. he said that i would have to pick my broadband up from store but he forgot to mention that i had a limited time to do so. i werenât made aware of this so when i got to the store it was too late and my broadband was no longer available. i called virgin media today to explain what happened and i was on the phone waiting to be connected for nearly an hour! i was connected to a very rude man who was very patronising. he kept talking to me as if i were a child or i couldnât understand him even though he could clearly tell my i was a fluent english speaker. he also kept talking over me when i pointed it out he turned it around and said i was talking over him! he then told me that he would not be able to honour what was proposed by the other advisor. i asked him to put me through to someone else or a manager as i couldnât communicate with him and he said âthey will just tell you the sameâ  he point blank refused! in the end i just told him to cancel my contract all together and he didnât even try to hold me back.  by going for a bigger company i thought i would get a better service than this  i am very disappointed and defiantly wouldnât recommend!!! i work in customer service myself and i would never talk to any of my customers that way even on a bad day! i just wish i got his name  so rude!,1.0

1492,was with virgin media for around 5 years with nothing but trouble on a regular basis with either the internet going down or tv going down...the reason why i stayed so long was because of the amount of devices i had running through the internet....2 pcs 4 ps4s 2 ps3s and a couple smart tvsâ¦.which netflix was playing on a regular basis on 4 devices at same time.....so thought bigger broadband was better...but six months ago...had enough of virgin and decided to jump to sky.....and wow..im running all the devices that i was running on virgin and no internet or tv down....word of advice for people when virgin turn around and say that there will be a final bill when all of the virgin devices are back to them..to make sure its done in the first month of ending virgin as if it goes over... virgin put it as a late payment on your credit.....which gives you bad credit,1.0
1493,my only advice is avoid like the plague. i have been with them 16+ years and the service has gone progressively downhill. dishonesty is their customer services is prominent..i can only advise you to record any conversation if it involves contracts money etc. i have been naive and after being told i was not on a contract..after trying to leave was told i was on a 12mth contract after a rather hefty price hike. they will pull the wool over your eyes and make it nigh impossible to leave without paying a hefty exit fee. loyalty means nothing they couldnt care 2 hoots.,1.0

1499,the worst customer service i have ever spoken to! i received missed calls from what they call a âspot checkerâ after requesting more information if i can obtain high speed broadband in my area. i called back as the voicemail from the gentleman was hard to understand. the man i spoke to was stressed  speaking over me  pushy and did not give a good impression or make me interested in signing up. i was wary if the call was even genuine hoping that virgin media would be more professional with customer service calls to potential customers. anyway after speaking to someone that i could actually understand i was informed that the previous calls were intact from the âspot checkerâ - the customer service team pass you onto different departments and have no clue what they are doing and keep transferring you. disappointed with my initial enquiry and after reading other reviews i have to agree with them all. poor customer service and sound like the reliability is not good either.,2.0
1500,the company has scam practices. good internet but they're such a scam. they failed to charge me my bill via direct debit  and only notified me of the failure after 15 days  when i would've been charged a â£10 late payment fee. such a scam and easy way to make money. extremely poor customer service as well - on one attempt to cancel my contract  i called in  took about 10 minutes before i was connected to a person  and this lady was forcing me to give my email so she could send me a referral code which i did not want. i repeatedly said i didn't want the code and she kept forcing me to. wanted to hang up but she hadnt finished the business  so had to fight over that and in the end the call ended because my prepaid airtime had finished. lol. never again,3.0

1513,i was with virgin for a number of years and a reliable payer of services and loyal. i have two teenage sons both of whom have naturally increased their internet use over the course of the years i was with virgin. both are gamers both like to stream movies  what teenager doesn't. that's where the issues started with this all singing fancy broadband  they claim  firstly the signal off their vivid 350 and the hub 3 is at best weak in upstairs rooms  then add to this the way they apply the fair use policy which involves limiting speeds to below snail pace at weekends when you need it most of all and you get a below standard expensive service.virgin claim unlimited downloads at high speed  what they don't tell you is they will restrict your service if your a high end user. now i only found this out when i was leaving virgin as the girl on the phone let slip that we may have been restricted because of our usage. we were finding 3 weekends out of four the internet seldom worked never mind being restricted and when it was working it was desperately slow.what i find highly amusing now is that the female customer services rep in their cancellation department arrogantly suggested that our use would be subject to restrictions with all other service providers. well here's the thing  i have been with bt for two years now and not only can i get a good signal from their hub all over the house but i also haven't been subject to fair use policy and my lads have only increased their use as have i. do not touch virgin if you expect to do streaming and online gaming. if you don't believe me re fair use then check the small print before you sign up for a package and you will see subject to fair use policy.,1.0

1538,i am really disappointed for virgin media. my partner and i have been waiting for the installation of internet over than 40 days. they cancelled twice our appointment for the internet connection so my boyfriend lost 2 days from his job waiting for them and they never came in. when finally they decide to come 3rd day off of his work  they said that they are not able to connect the internet in our flat the flat downstairs has internet connection with virgin media . moreover they said that their manager will call us back in the next few minutes and he she never called us back. afterwards i call them to cancel the internet apply with them and they told me that has already cancelled. this is at least ridiculous. not recommended at all.,1.0
1539,been with virgin for years & generally they haven't been too bad  sometimes you can lose connection for hours but overall  i've been satisfied ...... until now. three weeks ago i lost bb connection phoned them up to discover that they have disconnected me because somebody else had requested an account at my address !!!! was told i would be back on in hours  i wasn't. called back & was told an account had been set up for someone else & i had requested the disconnection ?????? they would have to close the new account before reconnecting me  this would take 72 hours. i wasn't reconnected  another 2 calls to be told basically the same  new account blah blah blah 72 hours blah blah blah. the last call i was told somebody had probably input the wrong address & they would have to phone the new account holder to find out where they were living & cancel their account before they can reconnect me !!!!!! now today i have received an email asking why i haven't returned their equipment & if i don't make arrangements to return it i would be charged. enough is enough  they can have their hub back & i will use an alternative for around â£20 25 instead of the â£51.50 i am currently paying just for broadband & phoneline. more fool me you could say well not anymore. cancelled dd today   will send them their hub & look forward to my next broadband experience.,1.0
1540,okay so i picked virgins 100mb download speed plan i thought that maybe it will be good at the start yes it is  however if you are a gamer or like a stable internet virgin will break down in your area in the most random times for example i was trying to watch some netflix today and i couldnt i payed my next due bill which i didnt have to do then i called up and they said that virgin is down in my area and will be up at approx 17:15 pm bere in mind its 8:30 am in the morning i have tried everything to make the ******* wifi work and it fails on me when i need it most when i wanted to watch netflix and relax **** i hate life,1.0

1546,just left virgin after 18 months. broadband speed was good but customer service is very poor. more interested in signing up new customers with better offers than with retaining existing customers. their customer service operator when i finally got through was more interested in selling me an upgrade than in what i wanted  - not interested in listening to the customer so voted with my feet. they also make it difficult to get in touch to leave so the best way to get in touch with them is to go onto the website and say you are a new customer - they soon pick up the phone for a chat then ! will try to sell you more packages and not listen to the customer which is the first rule of customer service. bye bye virgin.,1.0

1629,"joined via an official virgin media door to door salesman in october 2018. salesman offered me 50mb broadband  anytime landline calls  tv player bundle and free sky sports for 3 months â all for â£32 per month. it sounded like a great deal so i even got a friend to sign up via the same salesman. the numerous problems started from the get-go  i will list it out for easier reading. 1. i repeatedly told the salesman that i have never had virgin media before whilst signing a pre contract in my house. salesman still went ahead and booked the wrong type of installation  engineer thought i had a virgin line already installed . so i got a new installation date for 2 weeks later  had to call my previous provider to extend the notification period which was tricky. 2. also mentioned to the salesman  that i wanted the router to go into my bedroom due to my pc and gaming set ups needing an ethernet connection and to keep my existing landline number. salesman promised it can be done. installation day comes  second time around   engineer immediately dictates where the best place for the router to go ignoring my preference. engineer made so many excuses not to put it in my bedroom  probably because of the extra work needed  so i gave up and it ended up going in the living room alongside the tv box  i bought a powerline extender for â£50 just to connect my pc . after the installation  i then find out that my landline number has been changed  i was really frustrated because i have had that number for many years and was looking to keep it. 3. this is where it becomes even darker  i was getting a bit concerned in why i wasnât getting any emails as you do when you join a new provider and i wanted to make an online account. so i called up the customer helpline and they told me itâs because your email was incorrect .com instead of .co.uk. it was written clearly correct on the pre-contract paper handed to me by the salesman  to my shock my friend also had the same problem. 4. then out of curiosity i told the customer service guy to read out my package and lo and behold i was on a different package weekend calls and nothing about 3 monthsâ free sky sports  it was just a normal package offered online. my friend did the same and got the same outcome  even the email situation .com instead of .co.uk 5. i rang the salesman and he kept lying about it just being a mistake and it will be sorted out  basically he was trying to run down my 14 day cooling off period . he eventually stopped answering calls from me and my friend. i then spoke to a manager from the customer services and he agreed that there was some mis-selling going on and will honour what i was promised if i sent a copy of the pre-contract to his email  which i then did. he then replied that everything was sorted  far from the truth as i saw no change on my account. 6. the last straw  i called again  really wanted to cancel it as i was fed up and 3 days away from the cooling off period. was told the same thing by a different manager honour the contract etc. i then look at my account again and i see that my first bill is â£120 including 50-pound installation fee when i was promised free installation. the 2 managers basically messed up my package beyond repair. 7. i then called up to cancel it finally  had to repeat my story every time i called by the way. advisor said that i donât have to pay a penny because the cancellation is within the 14 day cooling off period. no surprise here  they then sent me a bill a week after cancelling of â£75 for god knows what reason  had to make further calls to customer service to sort this out  they said it was a mistake donât worry etc.in summary a had 2-3 weeks of hell  i was a loyal and happy sky customer before virgin  i got mis-sold by a sly virgin salesman called âkevinâ apparently who lied  the customer service from virgin is also appalling most probably due to untrained employees in the indian call centre  on top of all this the broadband service went down for 2 days in my area during my few days with virgin. at the end had to re-join sky. lesson learnt  virgin media is diabolical",2.0

1663,after being completely screwed over by bt  itâs nice to have virgin media back in our lives. our activation date for bt was over a week after signing up. then there were âissuesâ and they delayed it by another two weeks! called virgin and they sussed us a router and got us fibre broadband in two days. currently have an avg download speed of 150+ mbps! the only issue weâve had previously was at our previous property and the wifi kept going down - turns out too many devices. upgraded to router and no further issues! we love virgin media!,2.0
1664,is virgin the worst broadband provider in the country. i made the mistake of moving over in august and the wifi hadnât worked properly since  having to sit thru the constant buffering and even though they originally agreed to come and fix it changed their mind unless i paid for it. their useless call centre transfers you from one department to another  so i paid for the technician to come out and theyâve made it worse. they now refuse to come out a second time without me paying for it and one let slip you get buffering a lot in weekends due to high demand in the area. they never said that when they took my money. what a joke. i now have to go to the ombudsman. hopeless,3.0

'let me be clear  you want me to log into my hub and put the password in to make technical adjustments?!' i said absolutely gobsmacked. yup  he wanted me to start adjusting widths of channels for the wifi. i stopped him.  no i said.  the tv apps started to show a buffer circle  and then i went to the ipad app to check speeds on the line. the tv is hardwired into the virgin kit by the engineer.  it is all cables  i said.  all together.  it all worked and my app showed 70mbps until wednesday midnight or so. it has crunched since then. i left bt because of incompetent technical support and installations botched.   they used an old alarm cable - no really - to put the 70mbps signal through.  for the technical  it's got no shielding and it's only good for phone calls.  i installed it pre-broadband ffs.  it has no markings like cat 5 or cat 6 or cat v so the bt guy ought to have known.  upshot - 8 months of intermittent failure and changing parts in my pc until i found out what the muppet had done. anyway....i fixed that  and we just had to tolerate the very average mbps thereafter.  back to virgin...we have a tech appointment booked.  now  rakesh on the phone  said it is a hub that needs replaced.  i know this is unlikely.  i say  virgin have throttled us back after a ten-day honeymoon  and it's gone to heck since half the town switched to virgin  following the outrageous promises and the summer installing. i am an it specialist.  it's not the box  unless the box has an emergency backstop to go to 13mbps or so  which it has now defaulted to  because some part is fried. rakesh said initially it was an auto adjust patch of software that had failed to work properly  hence the manual attempt to make changes.   blah blah. not happy...i can smell what's coming  i will not have 11 months of this before bailing.  bt was better than this  even if it did take an ever-increasing sum of money and 18 months to get stable.  oh  plus i got a good asus hub with three aerials  and a piece of tin foil behind that  to magnify focus the wifi forward - it works. so here's the obvious rule emerging - it costs â£1 per mbps to get broadband that's good  along with a phone line etc. per month. we are on a 200mbps with virgin and the best i saw was 70mbps for ten days.  at half price of â£34 per month - there you go  if it works  it is only 70mbps not 200 but that's good enough  and surprise  â£1 per single mbps.  bt ended up at about â£67 per month for 40mbps to 73mbps. they only came up once virgin started digging and stone-cutting. this broadband lying thing  is so commonplace  not even regulators expect or can enforce anything else. the practical fix for us is to go back to bt and using the freeview channels on an ancient skybox and satellite dish. my problem is even if virgin fixed this on monday  at the tech appointment  i have no confidence until ten days or so are up  and if it plunges  that will likely be it for me. i don't want to argue all day with a tech guy i cannot understand.  i don't believe they know what they are doing  and they seemed pretty able to fob-off.  were i less forceful or less knowledgeable  they might have told me it was ok  and signed me off when they tried to get me to watch the tv app and if it was ok  say all was good. unpleasant  patronising  circular  i just find this tiresome  this broadband baloney.  i buy a car  i expect a 2 litre to be 1998cc at least.  don't sell me broadband quoting 200mbps  lie about the faults that arise  then try and make me wear the 5% of that service i get soon after install. no  it won't do.",2.0
1702,"phoned 3 times today. 1st time to get my virginmedia password re-issued as i couldn't get it sorted on line. i got a very helpful lady with an accent that makes me think she was not uk based. it took a while and she tried very hard to help and eventually she got it sorted  i think the problem was the system rather than her. try getting them on webchat  i have for 2 days and got absolutely nothing  anyway we got there in the end. the 2nd phone call was to query my bill  i got a man with a accent which again made me think he was not uk based and he repeatedly answered a different question to the 1 i was asking. he kept telling me no discount possible but i hadn't asked for a discount  i was querying my previous bills. he them proceeded to give me a postal address to send my correspondence to. when i asked for his manager  he said he didn't have one. i was starting to think he was being deliberately difficult so i thanked him for his time and hung up. the 3rd time i phoned was to cancel my contract as the previous idiot had annoyed me that much  and i had a fairly good offer from sky . i got a man with what i think was a welsh accent  he couldn't have been more helpful or honest if he tried. he directed me to where i could resolve my billing query and made me a pretty good offer for renewing my contract. the actual broadband is quite good if a little unstable at times. i have had terrible experiences with both bt and talk talk before so all in  they are not the worst. to virgin media management  sort out your customer services. cheap foreign call centers are not cost effective if they are losing you your customers.",1.0

1705,more of a review of their after sales service department than a review of the broadband which  when it works  has generally worked well. the problem lies when it fails  which has become more frequent of late  and the resulting palaver of trying to get it fixed. every time i ring up with a issue  i end up shouting at someone because they argue or ignore what i'm saying  or fob me off. recently  they have resorted to lying as regards the whereabouts of a missing technician  who was due between 1 and 6pm  but turned up at 8.20pm when my missus had gone to bed and the kids where doing their homework. needless to say  the visit was declined. i accrued one and a half hours on hold on the phone after 6pm  just trying to find out where the tech was  without success. if they can't even locate their tech  without upsetting a customer  then how are going to deal with a real fault?,1.0

1722,"i live in area 21  our internet has been intermittently down for 6 months  yes... six months! . there has been an snr issue for over 6 months that virgin has failed to resolve. they have given fake estimated times of resolution which are never met  month after month we are assured that the internet will be resolved by a given date. after that date  the internet still drops. we receive drops outs of over 10 hours  the longest was 16 hours . the customer service is horrendous  they don't even  at minimum  call the people affected to even attempt to explain the matter. it's a whole post code that is affected yet that isn't a priority  the level of priority of p4. p1 is the highest level of priority  up to p6 i believe  we are not given even compensation for the utter inconvenience of over half a year of intermittent internet. they just reimburse us for the time the internet was down. if i go to a shop and buy something  or pay for a service and that service isn't acceptable  at bare minimum you are reimbursed with what you should have gotten  plus atleast store credit  atleast. virgin  with their horrendous customer service  have said they can only pay back the money for the down time.  to put that into perspective  if you pay 30 pounds a month for internet  if your internet is down for 24 hours  so one whole day  regardless of you having to eat i to your minutes calling them  then they put you in a queue and bounce you around for an hour  regardless of you having to use your own internet  run out  purchase more internet  regardless of the inconvenience that it caused if your whole family  a family of 5 in the house  all who use internet  having to spend extra money in this fashion  regardless of deadlines you need to meet  research you need to do  personal things you want to watch online  coursework that needs to be completed  jobs that need to be applied to  you get â£1 back!! one pound. for all of your troubles  you get a pound back. it's outrageous. you may question why we are still with virgin  it's because we have been promised time and time again that by a certain date the internet will be fine and we will receive no issues after that. this has happened 4 5 times. it's disgusting  and virgin have not even reached a hand out in apology.  this is not the only issue. although it is a major issue  they are also deceivers. treacherous liars. they called us a few months back saying we needed to change our contract we had with them  threw a bunch of big fancy words at us and said our contract is ending and we need to change our to another  more expensive contract. we're not that dumb. we said we know our contract and we had no specific time frame to keep to. we had the proof to show that  and we didn't pay into a new contract. the next bill of ours went from â£40 ish pounds to â£50-â£60!! so we called them  explained the issue  they apologised and reduced our bill to â£10 less than our original bill  to â£30 . it's outrageous that such an issue would occur. moreover  their customer service are so pretentious. i work in it  i'm a second line engineer  i know my stuff. so when i call  i will speak to the customer service as i would speak to my own colleagues  specifically and precisely  using it terms the layman may not understand . the customer service team  almost every time i call  as i speak they cut me off  they raise their voice over mine  they don't listen to me and continue talking as if what i'm mentioning makes no difference  at times they would speak rudely once they realise i'm not budging and will say my piece.  we have changed our router roughly 4 times. virgin insisted the issue we faced  almost 7 months ago  was due to our router. after the 2nd time  we realised that this is a bigger issue than just our router. we mentioned to virgin that there is a bigger issue  to which they replied that they cannot do anything further than changing our router and checking the cables unless others in the area call up that their internet is also down. one of the technicians came  quite fortunately  at the time of the internet being down. he sat there confused as to why it was down. he plugged in another router ""just in case"" and we waited... still no internet. he was confused and said he's not sure what the issue is. a few months later they said there was an snr issue  single noise reduction issue. which is basically a faulty wire that sends data back up to the router in the back of everything and causes the problems i mentioned . so now that they know the issue  the fix is simple yet tedious. find the wire if they hired me  ran me through things and gave me the equipment  i'd do it myself! but they can't even find the root cause of the issue  all these months later  nothing.  if a person wants an internet service provider  don't go to virgin. their amazing speed that they have means nothing whatsoever if you can't make use of it p.s... my internet right now is down my area reference is 21 and my account number is 666078401",2.0

1794,when it is working broadband is fine  but it is not reliable  i use it for home business  telephoning to customer services is extremely bad  minimum waiting time is 30 minutes and they can log you out easily   last five months i have been phoning and asking for a vat bill  they said all sorts of  you have to ask the government to provide you a vat receipt   i believe  it is wasted time and energy. phone system is not reliable at all. simple things are extremely difficult with this company. i shall leave them and never come back again. some operators can be very rude too.,1.0
1795,virgin media have gone right down hill. pay extra for v6 box but the minute you lose internet connection you lose your tv channels. on demand service is atrocious with 7 day catchup instead of 28 days and customer service is ridiculous. nobody speaks english. broadband speed used to be okay but for the past year it has been rediculous. iv complained so many times to customer service about these things and they are not helpful at all. we don't get compensated for loss of connection. you would think the v6 box would be more updated for the price we pay. daylight robbery this is. i'm starting to really despise them,1.0
1796,terrible service  absent costuomer service.  when you call them plan to be on the phone for hours being passed on from one person to another  when you book a technician be prepared to take time off work numerous times and no one will turn up or notify you that they will not turn up. if you ask them to lay cables outside be prepared to not be asked where it will go as it will be laid where they like to lay thm hanging on thin wires  unsafe especially for children and elderly perfect for trip hazards  nailed to your house  and a massive roll of cable.  of course for this they turn up with no warning... so we have been for years with no working phone line  for weeks without internet  then we are told that we cannot disconnect unless we give 30 days notice  but just to find out that we already are disconnected on the same phone call.  no i would not recomend having to deal with vigin media,2.0
1797,broadband is good until they keep adding â£3 to your monthly bill every few months. when you want to contact them you want to leave they don't answer the phone and automatically cut you off after 20 mins. i called at 8:48pm plenty of time before their service ends at 10pm. i was cut off after being on hold for 20 mins three times overall on hold for an hour and not getting to speak to anyone. it's funny how easy they answer calls for new customers but a different story for existing customers. very poor quality of service.,1.0
1798,been with virgin for a few years  ive been meaning to change for a while as my kids are complaining about internet connection. however recently they lost some channels  that u can get on free veiw  i stuck with them  thought they would make it up some how  they have! they have increased the prices for their poor service! at this point things could have been sorted out  maybe with a discount or refund...not after waiting 38 mins for them to answer the phone  then for them to hang up when i went to look for a bill...5 mins tops! lets have a company that does a fixed price  good customer service and doesnt take its customers for granted...im going  dont get it they take your good money with no effort in return....regards martin,2.0

1806,"internet worked well for just over 2 years before we ran into our recent trouble. only when things go wrong do you realise how incompetent virgin media are.iâve currently been 3.5 weeks without internet. first issue was getting conflicting messages as to whether they knew there was an issue. online service checker said it was fine  but automated phone call recognised an issue. although it recognised an issue  it gave no eta of fix. found it very difficult to get through to a human to discuss the issue. most services are automated. twitter team offer zero practical help  just generic bile. when you do get through to a person itâs an call centre where the staff have no access to in-depth network problems. just the same old reset the router nonsense. calling the problem intermittent  itâs not intermittent  it was completely out! only when threatening to cancel  do you get to speak to someone who knows what they are talking about  which takes on average 45 minutes on hold to get through. the cancellation team are able to give an estimated fix date  but they have given me 2 dates now  both of which have been and gone. they claim the issue is only affecting a handful of houses  probably the reason they have no urgency to fix it. and just to round it off  got a letter through the post today saying the monthly bill is going up from october.",2.0
1807,virgin media is by far the most atrocious internet provider i have ever had the misfortune to suffer. at the moment we lose our internet connection on average once every 3 days. the only explanation ever given is ' we are improving our lines to give our customers a faster connection'. unfortunately they have been saying that for about a year now   no faster connection  no improvement. to top it all off  their customer service is the most unhelpful and rude i have come across. the only advice they have ever given is turn it off and on again. we have twice now requested a technician to come out and look at our cables and our device and both times virgin has cancelled the visit saying its no longer needed.,2.0

1843,"i tried to arrange installation for months. i signed a contract in may  and in early june i was told that it would take 6-8 weeks to organise the install as the council needed to provide consent for the works. my postcode is listed on their website as being in a vm area  and fibre cables run down my road. engineers attended and spray painted green markings on the side of the road and pavement to show the 1m distance the cable would need to be routed. i was informed that there was a budget for these works and the access point to be created on the boundary wall of the property  and that it was just a matter of time. having not heard anything for 8 weeks i called vm to ask for an update  and i was told that the install and contract had been cancelled as it was too expensive for vm to proceed with the required works and that a note had been put on the file to say iâd been informed. i hadnât been - not by email  text or phone call - and i still wouldnât know if i hadnât called. i paid â£300 to the freeholder for the wayleave approval which was completely unnecessary and i cannot reclaim. i would have thought it sensible for the budget for the works to be approved before the wayleave was submitted and signed  but clearly this isnât the case. iâve therefore wasted four months and â£300 to try to organise a service that could never be provided to me in the first place  despite vm assuring me otherwise. iâve never been so wildly misled by a company  and iâm furious that iâve thrown away â£300 for no reason whatsoever.",2.0

1895,"so i called virgin media about a problem with my broadband  the speeds  i'm paying the vip bundle package which is 80 pound a month they told me there's nothing wrong with my broadband wasn't willing to help fix my problem kept telling me the same thing over and over again they wouldn't let me speak kept talking over me telling me i don't understand about how the wifi works. now i'm a young adult i know how wifi works exactly. when i said that to them they said ""well if you know about wifi then fix your own problem"" i'm running speed tests which is only reading 40mbps of download speed and my upload speeds are 20mbps of speed i tried telling them this and they kept talking over me so naturally i did get frustrated on the phone because they were not listening!! i even spoke to a manager which he also took the same attitude from the start when i was simply trying to explain. i asked to speak to his boss and he went off the phone and put me back on to the previous woman i was speaking to i said ""can i speak to his boss please""she said ""there is no other boss"" which is lies obviously. all i wanted was for someone to fix my speed they kept saying i need a lan cable i shouldn't have to get a lan cable. my speeds should be reading at least over 100mbps on average without a lan cable considering the package  i'm on. my friend has virgin in and they pay 30-50 pounds a month and they are getting 100mbps speed without a computer or a lan cable. overall virgin has very bad customer service. talk talks customer service is much better and that's saying something.",2.0
1896,i too was seduced by the lure of super-fast broadband  so signed up to virgin's vivid200 package. what a mistake  because on a good day i'm lucky if i get 20mbps  with regular disconnections. a friendly engineer has visited  and replaced the router and internal cabling  but it has unfortunately not helped. don't believe their sales pitch of real average speeds. i now feel conned  and think this represents a clear case of misselling. in the part of brixton  london  i live it would appear they simply don't have a properly functioning network or capacity to deliver a decent service. i now have to make peace with the fact that i will have to make do with a poor broadband service for the next few months until my 12 month contract ends and i move to another provider. as a footnote  i have just run another speed test and guess what  i achieved 9.98mbps - nowhere near the promised 200mbps i signed up for! if you do want to move to virgin  i suggest you sign up for a single month to test out what they are able to deliver to your home before contracting for a longer term.,1.0
1897,terrible customer service. wasted my one hour speaking with this guy on the phone just to cancel my service which i no longer need. extremely rude and unprofessional. even though i made it clear that i donât want the service  he constantly came up with cheap alternatives and started bothering me. after a long conversation  he just put me on hold for 2 min which was meant to be forever and later on i had to hung up the phone. didnât get the chance to cancel my service. extremely pathetic way to deal with the customer. never coming back to virgin media and would not recommend to any one as well. stay away from it  it sucks everything out of you like leeches.,2.0

1901,the last time i called was to cancel as the prices shot up and the offer they gave me was not suitable. the guy i spoke to was the most rudest arrogant person i have ever spoken to in my life  he seriously should not be working in customer services if he does not have any manners or people skills. i would make a complaint but i know either nothing will get done or he will get a minor telling off. wouldnât stay with the company if theyâve offered me the services for free now after the way i was spoken to. being spoken to with respect and politeness has a big impact on your customers!!! never ever returning to virgin media again.,2.0
1902,the worst customer experience i have ever had. they charged me a direct debit payment even after me telling them to cancel my contract and when i contacted them to address the issue  they were really rude and transferred me from one advisor to the other and the last advisor ended the call on me. the worst internet provider out there  a little above average speed but worst reliability and worst customer service. stay away from virgin media.,2.0

1910,having been with virgin media for 8 years  i have finally cancelled my contract due to an unacceptable deterioration in their services. when i first became a customer in 2010 i was impressed with the broadband service and this continued for 5 years  using them in two properties. for the last 3 years  despite paying for the 100mbs package  i have had ongoing issues with speed  reliability and most notably  wireless signal. despite many calls to their tech teams and eventually a replacement router  the service if anything has continued to deteriorate. one customer service agent admitted that virgin media have oversold their product in certain areas and do not have the capacity to provide the broadband speeds as advertised  or it seems  the reliability. be vary wary of their advertised speeds - i have been unable to consistently achieve much over 20mbs at best via my wireless router for almost three years  despite having a 100mbs package.,1.0

1915,i am one unhappy customer & to feel how ive just been treated.... back in march 2018 i stated id like to reduce my broadband  tv & phone package as im want to save some money due to moving within the next few months   remember all calls are recorded   so i stated im moving within the next few months. package dropped for me & they stated my tv box was out of date so im entitled to a free box as ive been a valued customer for 23yrs. yep a long time.... the point to this is i have now moved and contacted them about my move & id like to keep my service at my new place thats out of town. but? got told they dont supply cable to that area. little gutted as always had a great service from them. yes i was happy till i get told they put me on another 12 month contract   remember i stated at the beginning i am moving within the next couple of months   not happy i stated listen to the recorded message & i stated i am moving so that member of staff should of said due to you moving i would advice not to change your package untill you move or it will put you on another 12 month contract & im sure all would agree here with me as i also deal with customers. also she should had stated what the address to your new place so we can check we have cable in that area. yet again another customer service point that should be asked but was not   they can also listen back to the recording   so with me now one unhappy customer being told i have 8 months to pay for and me stating all ive said above to listen back & also to hold that recording on file for me to take matters to court if need be  her reply was thats fine you take us to court as you will lose as we are a big company and will all cases and you will end up paying court cost... then at that point i was more than pissed off with that kinda customer service & i stated if she worked for me you would be sacked on the spot for that kinda attitude.... now in the post at my new address i have a red letter stating what they will be taking from my account. i have blocked this direct debit and now will proceed to higher matters. but never again would i now use virgin media again...,2.0
1916,i have had virgin services on and off over the past 20 years. yes they have their flaws but so does others! i just switched back to them simply because my bt services had to be reported several times a day to work normally. what you guys need to realise that if th live in middle of no where you will have more issues about broadband and telephone. j live in a town it's a decent size town and we dont get issues. i on my left virgin before because they were expensive. now they have a â£29 deal for all 3 services i tried all others and they charge more for once virgin is the cheapest. oh 1 more thing most internet providers now will lock you in to 18 months contracts virgin still 12 months only.,2.0

1919,my beef is this. i have a home office but often work away from home. i also need to divert my phone from time to time to a colleague. virgin have a phone divert package - although it took endless calls and research on line to find this out - however  you can only operate it by physically standing in front of your landline and punching in the divert codes. all other telephony companies i have used in the past offered a package with a remote call divert on-off option. but not virgin. not only that  but their call divert fee is higher! i have to text a housemate every time and get them to do it. also  the call divert is just a couple of clicks  no vice saying that it has happened   so sometimes you think it's switched over  when it hasn't. really primitive.poor.,2.0

1922,i have never been mucked around so much by a call center. it was literally easier for me to cycle 40 minutes with my modem in hand than it was for me to cancel my account. i am currently working in a different country and only have a small interval to call in  and whenever i did i had issues. the last stint i was transferred repeatedly until the 13p min had climbed to 30 minutes. after being transfered for so long  i began to lie to try to get through the beaurocracy  and then after throwing a tantrum and calling back  some idiot repeatedly asks me why i have been given different information. she persisted for another 10 minutes while only mixing it up with trying to offer me different deals. if i dont want your services  just cancel it! lets no pretend like you didnt charge my an extra 44 pounds for the 3 days i was late to cancel  crooked thieves.,2.0

1925,our internet started getting slower and slower sober started looking elsewhere but virgin said they had a new box and they would send us the tivo box too free or charge and our internet would be super fast. it's worse than ever! we are having to reset the router at least 5 times a day which is not helpful when you work from home after hours and the upstairs tv only runs off  the  internet! the tv constantly stops catch up programs and tells us to try again later. the issues are ridiculous and to be honest i woukd try another provider,2.0

1927,absolutely appalling service.  at first the broadband speed was okay then it started dropping off intermittently everyday!  called customer services on several occasions  they say they running diagnostics  changing channels etc. and still the problem is not resolved.  they refused to send out an engineer for wireless connection problems even though numerous attempts to fix over the phone have failed.  the final straw came when i told if i want to disconnect the service that was my decision. surprise  surprise when i call the disconnections team they offer to send an engineer! apparently  virgin and other broadband companies do not supply wifi so if you have a problem you're on your own.  perhaps i should connect all 8 of the gadgets to the box with a cable! thank you virgin for taking my money for no service and basically telling me it's my problem if nothing works not yours!,2.0

1947,even though we have been pleased with our virgin packages for over 20 years  we find it rather sad that they are not prepared to match a price offered from a competitor site even though we have been a loyal and prompt paying customer for so many years.  if that is the way virgin treat their loyal customers then shame on them. we noticed that a new customer can get a good deal though!!,1.0
1948,very bad connection! iâm a new user of virgin media and the wifi was not even working good on first months! everything struggles to work. sometimes wifi just turns off for 20 mins and you canât do nothing to make it work. at firs i was thinking that maybe the device has some problems or something like that and iâve checked on the website that maybe thereâs a problem in the area but always answer was positive that everything is perfect. iâm very very disappointed about this...,2.0

1965,me and my partner tried to get virgin at home. we booked the installation for last friday and received the equipment that came with missing pieces. we waited for the technician to sort the problem and after all day waiting were told that he would only come today  tuesday   when he came told us that was not possible to install virgin here. went to the shop and no one actually tried anything to help us. we still don't know why we can't have this because the only thing that the manager did was cancel our service without even asking us if we would like to have the problem sorted. we were once again almost 2 hours in the store looking to the manager on the phone  this hadn't told us what he was doing  and after all this he told us the problem was sorted and everything was cancelled. awfull service and organisation. the manager didn't have any knowledge about the engineer coming to our place and there is no one we can actually talk with about a problem. when we left the shop we looked for another servidor and found a sky shop  they were completely into everything about service and we were helped so much better in here!,1.0
1966,ever since we got the new box and router from virgin media we've constantly had issues with the broadband. it stops working at least once a week. had no broadband all day sunday 3rd june. same happened a couple of months ago and was promised a rebate on my bill by customer services. never got the rebate  they actually added â£4 on! when i eventually got through to customer services on sunday i was told there was a problem in my area and it will be sorted  at 9.25pm which i thought was a very precise but odd time. it still wasn't sorted at 5am monday morning. i begrudge paying â£80 a month for a service i can't use. am shopping around for another provider but virgin are the only ones who do fibre optic broadband in my area. old router we had before the so called upgrade was much more reliable and faster. virgin customer service are diabolical trying to pacify you when you call them from the scripted sheet they work off  and the call centre is in india so you have a hard time trying to understand them. waste of money. avoid at all costs,2.0

1969,i signed a contract for broadband and landline. when the contractors came they said they had no instruction to install the telephone  and they now say there is not the capacity to do so. very disappointing and feel i have been cheated. i signed and they signed  but .... i have to pay quite a bit to have a separate phone and that was not the deal i signed up for. beware cheeky chappies with their sales talk!,2.0
1970,i moved to virgin because of the fibre broadband. i was not interested in the phone  but they convinced me that just paying 2â£ extra getting a 29â£ package i would get phone and tv. did that and then they said it would be easier if i gave them my current phone number  as it would be easier to move my current phone and then they would automatically with my current provider in cancelling our services. i did that. they installed the broadband but they said they could not install the phone  but they would contact me in a couple of days. i was never contacted  so i called and they said that sorry but still they could not give me an appointment for the phone. afterwards  my first bill came  it was 135 â£. i called virgin and they said not to worry that because the system sees that i do not have phone installed  it is not calculating properly my bill and that they would put the extra on my next bill. the next month  again my bill was very high  called virgin and said that they had a capacity issue and cannot install the phone. i realized then that also my previous provider were still billing us. i told them that why did not they cancel my services and they said that because they could not install the phone they did not cancel. after talking to manager  instead of fixing the problem the solution they gave me is to move to a more expensive package without phone of 45â£  to cancel or to go to deadlock. they told me if i accepted the new package  or cancelling i was not allowed to make any further complaints. they did not want to reimburse my activation fees  or the fact that i was paying for phone but never got the service. in addition  that i was being billed from another provider. the manager was so rude and kept on saying that all this is in my contract. when i asked her to tell me where in my contract does it state this  she said she said she will come back to me. she called me again  and said it was not in the contract but they could not honour it and these are the solutions they are providing me. i asked her to send me in writing and she said that that this was not part of the process they followed. it was a nightmare.,2.0

1990,although virgin probably have the fastest speed rating they are not the most reliable the broadband quite regularly drops and as for streaming that is a joke . the most irritating thing about them though is the fact that when you do have a problem and you need to speak to someone you very rarely get someone in the uk on the other end of the line they are in another country thousands of miles away and don't speak very good english and they can sometimes be very rude so i am not impressed with customer service at all so if i can find another broadband service with speeds that can equal virgin media then i will be moving .,1.0

2014,we recently received a marketing call from virgin telesales team 10  a lady by the name abi. as we are not with cirgin on the broadband package   we are with sky  she offered us the fibre 100 package   telephone and broadband only  at â£29 per month. the deal was good as am currently paying â£38 with sky. i did inform her that we had previously tried to join virgin for broadband but were informed that no space is available in our area. she confirmed that space was now available. i informed her that as i was with sky  before i join virgin  i needed to find out when my contracts end with sky and what the cancellation charges are  so as to avoid unnecessary double charges. we agreed that i would call her the next day after speaking with sky. i did speak with sky and they told me the cancellation charges were â£44  which was acceptable to me  hence informed sky to cancel my contract. i immediately called abi  who stated taking my details down i order to join virgin. half way down the call  the phone got disconnected  since then i have been trying to contact abi with no luck. i then tried calling virgin through their helpline  spoke to another sales consultant who informed me that i could not join virgin as no space was available in my area. this was a shock to me since abi had promised me space was available  and based on that i cancelled my existing contract with sky. this is tiattalynnot acceptable of virgin  luring new client to sign up for a deal  making them cancel their existing contract with other providers  only to inform them later on that they cannot provide the service due to unavailable space. i will never join virgin ever again due to poor business ethics.,1.0
2015,"virgin media's standard business practice is to bill you for a full month in advance despite receiving a prior instruction to terminate the connection.  on top of this  refund of your mandatory over-billing is via a cheque. this is apparently preferable to a direct transfer back in to the account you paid them from. i can think of two possible reasons for this: i  it's 1993ii  virgin media are hoping you are too lazy to deposit the cheque so they can stiff you on the bill they should never have levied in the first place which do you think?",2.0

2196,probably the worst broadband someone could have. the connection always falls  sometimes 9 10 times a day  and we have to call every single day for them to momentarily solve the issue. a technician came in and changed the rooter  only for it to stop working after less than 24 hours. every person weâve spoken to is quite helpful but this doesnât solve the actual problem  which has been persistent. please think twice before choosing virgin broadband since it is the crappiest broadband out there. and weâre stuck with a 12 month contract although weâll only be living in this flat for 6 months and donât know how to get out of it since there wasnât a shorter contract and we thought it was at least going to work properly but it doesnât. a supervisor is meant to come on friday and we can only hope theyâll resolve the issue  although i immensely doubt it. do not choose virgin broadband  itâs so not worth it!,2.0

2200,"avoid avoid avoid please read this before choosing to go with virgin they are useless and break their own terms and conditions but expect you to abide by them even without seeing them this is my experience with them i called virgin in january 2017 to have services installed into my property an instalment date for beginning of february was arranged and i was told by the sales team and in txt messages that before they come in they have to do a site check to make sure all cables are in place but they do not need access to my house  why they asked in a txt message if i would like to be in for this baffles me if they didn't need indoor access  after several call to virgin and then to the actual telecommunications company  kellys i was told that the cables are in place and ready to install at my property. fast forward to my instalment date of 2 2 2017 an engineer arrive to install my equipment only to find that the cable had were not ready and him and another colleague that he called came round and they themselves run the cables  the poor man was at my property for nearly three hours. once all the cables had been laid the installation went ahead the engineer was very polite and helpful although did seem a little perplexed that he had to do the job of someone else. after no more than two weeks i was searching through the channels and i noticed that certain freeview channels were not available to watch as they were not included in my package  after calling virgin i got told this if you want those channels you have to upgrade at a cost of an extra â£10 per month when i asked why i cannot have freeview channels and the clue is in the word freeview which means they are free to view the response i got was yes but we would be charging you for the extra channels that wasn't free to view i.e documentaries i did ask to just have the freeview channels to which i got told this wouldn't be happening  during this conversation i asked for my account number  my telephone number and a copy of their terms and conditions  i got told we cant give you those details over the phone due to data protection but they would send them out in the post. a few days on i noticed that my tivo box seemed to be buffering for quite a while when trying to watch recordings i called virgin to see if there was a problem and after several arguments with them saying that they cant access my account without either my account or telephone number i explained well if you  give me these things i would be able to tell you them and again i asked for them and their terms and conditions  i finally had to tell them to access my account using my postcode to which they did  after a few checks i was told there is a national problem and this is the reason the boxes aren't working i had to explain again that my box was working just buffering to which they replied ah well then you are not part of the national problem and they hung up on me  so i had to call back by this point i am now very frustrated and expressed that this in unacceptable  albeit i was polite and will opening admit i swore and got told we do not have to deal with such language to which i replied its not against you personally but about the company you choose to work for  they finally agreed to send an engineer  in two weeks times to which i said ok can you pls send him with a new tivo box as this one is clearly dodge. i waited in all day at a loss off â£300 for no one to turn up when i called to find out what the hell is happening  again i was angry i got told the screen said i said dnt bother turning up when i in fact i said there would be no point turning up if he isn't bringing a tivo box with him  they then tried to arrange another appointment to which i asked them to agree that if they dnt turn up again for a second time the would reimburse me the loss of â£300 to which they refused saying our terms and conditions state we have 3 attempts to turn up again i reiterated that i still haven't got them or account and telephone number  so almost a year later im still using and paying for a dodgy tivo box. in june i noticed that a certain prog was only recording for an hour as per their listings but the program was actually on for an hour and fifteen min to which i was told well we need 48 hours to update their systems and i could always watch it on catch up. a few months on i noticed that my internet kept dropping out or simply not working again i called and had the usual c**p from them about needing account number  by this point i was losing the will to live  the lady done a check on my internet line and told the problem should now be fixed to which i replied well its not cos its still doing the same again i got told an engineer had to come out to which i refused on the basis they dnt turn up  so now i am paying for a dodgy tivo box and internet that chooses when and if it wants to work i received an email from virgin in september saying this is your pre contract just sign and send back and we can start your services in feb  i have in fact been paying since feb as they were installed. at the beginning of this year 5 1 18 my series link didn't record one of my programs when i checked to see if it was on i noticed that the listings said the said prog had been first aired the friday before  the prog was hollyoaks and they never repeat  i didn't call virgin as i accept that sometimes these things happen or so i thought  on 11th jan i notice that again my box wasn't recording a prog on itv  loose women  i checked the listings to see that the program before  this morning  was on from 10:30 to 13:30 as this program is live i thought there must be some sort of breaking news so i turned to itv so see what had happended and low and behold their were four women sitting behind a desk with a sign behind them stating loose women i checked my sky box  which i had installed back in june due to their incompetence of me missing the end of my programs and also checked my freeview tv listings and asked my niece who lives in a completely different property to check her now tv box and all three were showing loose women was showing. i called virgin and again went the same rubbish about account number ect to be told by a very helpful person  in scotland  that her box didn't record the same prog on monday either so it was at this point we worked out the prob couldn't be my box  after being put through to faults i was told we will do a check on your box and refer this to the network department and they would contact me within four days i asked what happens if this happens again to which i was told and i quote ""we promise this wouldn't happen again"" i expressed that this had happened back in june so what was the protocol to which he replied ""i dnt know"" so i told him go ask your manager and call me back. fast forward four and half hours no call back so i called back only to be told that prob takes four hours not four days to solve and that they will speak to second line  he came back and said i would need an engineer to come out to which i replied why when one of your co-workers had the same prob i got told in rather a rude manor well you didn't tell me that before i went through to 2nd line i replied this is should be on your screen as i had expressed this to the last person i spoke to - surprise surprise they didn't put this info on the computer. after several phone calls to second line myself we established that indeed it was not my box but there listings but they couldn't do anything about past recordings but do i know any future ones that are incorrect  surely this is not my job to check but i did and i informed them.  i then finally put my complaint into tom mockridge  ceo  by email and after again several calls back and forth i received a letter from them stating that unless i do not have service for a whole twenty four hours then i wouldn't be credited at this was their terms and conditions  which i still have not received  but have received my account and telephone number now in this letter dated 18th january 2018  they also stated they do not advertise they are a fault free services as you can imagine my response was not nice but i simply worded it i have never advertised that i am a millionaire but would they accept i can only pay three weeks out of the four i thnik not at the time of writing this review virgin have until close of business today to solve this prob and upon checking the two progs which i informed them were incorrect listing last week are still saying the same..... i dnt hold much hope that they will be updated by 10pm this evening so another  and this time i wont be as polite  email will be send this evenings and if they dnt apply credit to account i will simply apply my own by not paying my next months bill",1.0

2241,virgin media is an internet provider that does not understand the internet. the service goes down very often and when you contact customer service they think an acceptable response is that the service may come back in the next 24 hours! this response would be completely unacceptable for any other services  i.e. gas  electricity  water  but obviously virgin media believes that  home broadband is a dispensable service and that its disruption will only caused a minor annoyance on people's lives. if they want to provide broadband solely to people who go online every other day and still refer to it as 'browsing the web' good for them  but they should warn regular users before they join.,3.0

2271,"my experience with virgin media couldnât be any worse.after creating 2 diferente new accounts due to staff incompetence i had the broadband up and running for almost 2 weeks when it stopped working... phoned them up and they told me they couldnât find any active account under my name but 2 never accounts which where never activated.... so had to create a 3rd account that took another week to be activated and worked just fine for nearly 2 months when it just stopped working again.... it will take them another few days to send someone to fix this new issue if not longer... i would avoid virgin media at all costs! i initially went for it as it was the only company that could provide fiber optic toy flat . iâve regret my decision since the creation of my 2nd account .",1.0
2272,awful customer service. price for tv service just goes up and up every year  yet we lose the tv service regularly  no explanation provided to us  and no refund offered!  if you call them it will take you 10 minutes to get through to someone human and they are rude and unhelpful.  they almost seem to play games with you on the phone so you run out of credit and go away.  awful  avoid this company.,2.0

2274,"well it all started one shiny morning  when my virgin broadband stopped working  i looked out of the window to see virgin van outside and guys digging something in the pavement  i went out and they said they damaged the cable but going to fix it. well they didnt  so i called customer service and they sent the guy next working day to see it  the guy came and said what i already knew  the cable is damaged and the new one needs to be put in  they have set the date in 2 weeks to do that. well  one day before the installation date i got a call saying that they are not coming due to some construction works needed to be done. and set yet another date in 2 weeks time  so 1 month from the day they themselves  damaged the cable. remember im without internet for 2 weeks already and we  knew at first day that this has to be done. so i called virgin and questioned that  they apologised and passed me to the tech team  who said dont worry we are going to send another tech guy tomorrow and he will fix it temporarily until we fix it properly 2 weeks later.the guy came next day and what do you think he said? yet again the same words that the cable is damaged and new one has to be put in  i gave up calling after that  as i could see there is no point so i was waiting another 2 weeks  1 month in total for them to come and fix it. do you think there is a happy ending? well you are optimistic.the evening before virgin were to come to fix it   1 month after the fault was reported  i called their customer service just to confirm that everything is going ahead and someone is finally coming  and to check the time frame when.the customer services dropped the line 2 times  then when i finally got through  they couldnt answer  so passed me to tech team? they couldnt answer or confirm anything as well  so i was passed to construction department  and the answer i got: oh we actually are not coming tomorrow  someone should have called you  nobody did  as we cant do it  we have to do construction works and it can take up to 6-8 weeks. at that point i was truly shocked as  i couldnt believe its all happening. so i asked to cancel my account  i must admit this is the only efficient and quick thing i got from virgin  i was told that my services are disconnected within probably 2 minutes  no questions asked.  to summarise  avoid at all costs  appalling absolutely shocking service all the way through  thats me being their customer for a few years.",2.0
2275,"probably the most shocking and disgusting customer service i've experienced in my life. i phoned up to cancel my subscription because they had hiked it up to â£90 a month for basic broadband  phone and basic tv  and the guy on the other end of the phone accused me of using ""enough broadband of a family of four to use"" when i'm only here two days a week and evenings ... he then called me a liar and thought he could switch it off twice before the date it was due to end despite the fact i had paid for it. he then went on to say they wanted to equipment back and were sending bags out despite the fact customers pay for the equipment themselves and there isn't any claws stating they have to have it back  or that there would be any charges in the contracted agreement. i later discovered through talking to open reach engineers this is a tactic that they use often  to scare subscribers into staying or keeping their old equipment long enough that it isn't worth anything.  my advice to all  despite deals they may offer you avoid virgin media as if it was the plague. not only is their service disgusting but their broadband is awful with download speeds dropping to 0.1 mb at times  and yes i did complain and yes i tried everything to improve it . they'll hike the price up eventually anyway to the point you might as well go climb jacks magic beanstalk and fight the giant for the golden egg  because that's what you'll need to afford these daylight robbery prices.",2.0

2278,virgin media are absolutely the worst broadband as they have promised me that my internet should be working by a certain time and that time is way over due. furthermore  they are way too expensive so please do not get this rubbish broadband!,2.0
2279,just spent over an hour on the phone just to try and find out if it would be cheaper to cancel 6 months early or continue paying monthly amount until the end of our contract. couldnât understand what the customer service team were saying  they said manager wasnât available and were rude on the phone. never using virgin broadband again,1.0
2280,we were with virgin media for years and my mom did not notice they have been increasing the rental every year. it says 100mbps but speed drops when i stream. wifi disconnects couple of times per day and then need to reconnect. they advertise that they have highest internet speed but when i compare vodafone 38mbps  my new provider  no noticeable different. we could have left virgin years ago. anyway finally did.,1.0
2281,by far the worst  uk utility company i have dealt with ever in britain  i mean ever. such a disorganised mess of  company from customer services to mainly engineers who donât care. young guys who guess what to do when when they come to your property.  8 engineers since april when i  my mrs  changed from sky to virgin. complete in prosessional farce. this truly an example of management  corporate getting it wrong  iâm desperate to get back to sky. i will say that loudly  . no phone line working  pixalted pic  pooor internet  8 so called engineers under 20  clearly apprentices   so much a lot more  and the lies and lack of coherence with call center admin. i donât know how a company can justify such an 8 month farce. i canât be bothered any more. i just for april 18. i repeat the worst utility experiance you will face. i live in london  iâm not iâm yhe country side. there is no justification for this . from gas to water  i donât understand how a communications utility i moany of this scale can get away with this in the uk,2.0

2283,when we first got the contract with them  we waited for 45 days for someone to come to install the broadband and we were lied twice about the date. when we moved  we announced in advanced  they booked us  no one showed up  when my husband called they said there are some problems and we have to wait 6 weeks. we cancelled the account  one week later  my husband received a call with an offer and a date of installation  and again no one showed up. when we called customer service  the guy gave us another date  two weeks later. we refused. this is unacceptable for such a big company to lie about appointments. i took my day off twice for nothing because of them. talktalk are coming in 10 days for installing the broadband.,3.0

2286,they are con artists. i don't want your slow  infuriating tv box. i don't want the landline that  even it i wanted to  i don't   i can't use because their engineer broke the wires when installing next doors broadband. and i don't want to be offered deliberately misleading 'deals' only to find you downgraded my speed without bothering to tell me. virgin media are the pits.,1.0

2288,so bad ive spoken with around 15 team member from virgin media who still did not resolve the problem intact made the problem.so much worse for myself. according to my app status i had a bug from 17th nov until 25th nov and another bug which would be completed on the 1st december dec. also i paid my bill in october to find out in november my â£18.00 a month virgin broadband is now â£60.06 no one at virgin media the 15 employees at virgin media including customer service team collections team or the payments team could not  explain why my bill was so much. the excuse i received was i had to pay my bill because i've been cut of at the mid of november due to no payment but virgin media just happened to have forgotten about the cheque amount of â£35.88 approx which virgin media received on the 23 october i sent with a covering letter asking for my account to be credit to my account as this simple job was not completed my services have been restricted. also my virgin media expries on 1st dec and virgin media took.it upon them self's to sign me up to another contract without my authorisation and without my knowledge. i have spend all year ensuring my bills get paid and to not affect my credit with default due to virgin media incompetence and very rude member especially phillippines. i am escalating this issue in writing as a formal complaint.thank you for a bad week,3.0
2289,worst   i genuinely mean it  the worst customer service. i have ever dealt with  ever iâm the uk. itâs so terrible itâs scary and strange that they are able to get away with con and no action despite all the negative reviews not one positive remark and despite that they do nothing to rectify  . i ersonallly in north london am facing a nightmare since april 07 . no phone line  ever    pixilated tv and poor engineers who donât care .  donât use this company,1.0
2290,"absolutely shocking service and customer service from virgin. would not recommend to anybody unless a ""new customer""they don't look after their customers who have been with them a long time! it's just hit and miss if you get a decent deal or if you're robbed blind. but everytime i ring they try robbing me blind! and then i find out that a family member is receiving more in their package and cheaper than what i'm paying. i ring to request sky sports adding to my package and the best they can offer is nearly â£20 more than what i'm paying now and they can't lower my package even though i've been a frequent customer. they only look after new customers to get the numbers and once you're with them they don't give a s*** about you.avoid them like the plaque your better off not bothering.  also their customer service team are rude and unhelpful! shocking!",2.0
2291,i was charged an early cancellation fee of â£140 because i'm moving to a place virgin media does not service. i would've been willing to transfer my broadband to the new location but it appears it's my fault that i moved to a place they don't' supply. as my only consolation  i was told that i signed a contract and could've looked for a place that virgin media supplies before i moved. really quite horrible for something out of my control. also wildly more expensive than most other internet providers for unreliable broadband. i wouldn't use them again.,2.0
2292,happy to say i have now left virgin media  after years of hassle with them  broadband was rubbish  and they were the most difficult company to contact as you rarely get to speak to someone in the uk. still waiting for credit back from them. and unlike other companies when you leave would not let me keep my old ntl email address even though i offered to pay for it. they were so unhelpful.,2.0
2293,overprices and undervalues customer loyalty  prices continues to increase every year and claim it is due to wanting to provide better service but that seems to be a investment to be better than their competitors at the cost of the customer who don't want to change their broadband package   they seem to appreciate new customer more over existing ones and even being with them for 8-10 years i pay more than new customers and they cant seem to offer better deals unless u pay more when u cant afford it.,1.0
2294,yet again my broadband is not working. and when i contacted customer service received have been told i must wait for an engineer at a time that suits there needs and will cost me money by taking time off work . somewhat unfair when you consider that if any of us were to fail to pay our bills we would  receive a letter demanding payment . but when we do not receive the services we pay for virgin has little for the contract they would enforce for only there need,1.0

2296,worst broadband company that i have ever joined with. i just recently moved property and found out that they don't  provide their services to my new property. therefore i have to pay â£152 cancellation fee  which does not make sense in any way  because i am not cancelling because i want to  but i have no other option because even if they provide me with another option i still get charged the â£152 cancellation fee. this is just robbery  and i recommend no one to join virgin media at all.,2.0

2298,"be very careful with your bill. they just hit me with a price increase not priorly informed of. i have just a broadband package which states a set price for 12 months with an installation fee. there was a general price increase on november 1st which i did not receive confirmation of nor is it in my contract that my introductory plan was subject to any increase. low and behold  my latest bill goes up by â£2.99 a month. their online chat service is never available  there is no availability of the previous contact with customers online nor could i find any such confirmation of an increase. i called virgin media today - the lady talked over me  told me a confirmation had been sent but she could not provide that email confirmation to me and then told me to stop being rude. i have lost my voice  so was unable to raise my voice in any way  i was explaining my situation when she just cut me off saying 'i'm going to just put through to the team'. i was already on hold by the time i got through to what was actually the retention team. i spoke to sarah there  who rectified the problem and gave me a credit of the â£2.99 per month until my contract expires  so all worked out in the end - i assume a glitch in the system that means even us 'new favoured' customers get stung and they cash in on those who don't notice or check that they shouldn't get an increase. with this in mind  what they're doing here is illegal. a notice must be given of any increase and it must be stated in the t&cs that price increases are allowed on introductory offers  neither of which happened here. had i have not checked my bill regularly and noticed this discrepancy  contacted them myself and specified my knowledge of the law  i would have just been charged more - who knows how much more i would have been charged going forward. this company has the monopoly in my area  i was with a previous provider when i moved here and couldn't get more than 1mb download speed so i do not have a choice but to go with vm. this makes it very difficult to be a consumer and action my right to pay to be with a fair and trusted company.  if you have a problem with your bill  don't call the normal number  they won't help you. the retention team can be called on 0800 052 8310.",2.0

2367,"i'm going to write an honest review as it seems most reviews are from people who come online while they are upset so i wanted to write one from a neutral perspective to help people decide. overall virgin media is pretty good though it does come with a few problems and they have recently told me that when it comes to reimbursement from downtime they do it specifically by the day  in other words they no longer give you anything back as a gesture which i think is bad for a company that makes millions off every day people  one of the things for me that keeps me with a company is how they treat you and appreciate you as a customer  o2 lead by example on this!!  so they have become pretty greedy with money really and i think this should be changed. about the speeds  well generally i get good solid speeds of around 70 - 75 mb on the download and this is usually good  even on wi-fi too on my phone i get this and the signal seems pretty strong considering the router is upstairs and the room downstairs connects fine with the blu ray player which is opposite side of the house downstairs  we get around 2 - 3 bars on the signal strength and netflix words fine but  and this is a big but  their consistency isn't the greatest and i have had a few outages recently and quite a lot of line drops  some of these line drops are so small you don't notice but they are there and stability isn't really their strongest thing  i'm not sure if any other company has this but virgin definitely don't   watching sky go can often get the odd buffer due to this and i do think this is something virgin need to get sorted considering they're not the cheapest of the bunch  which brings me to that point  the cost. virgin media are a little over priced  in fact very over priced really because although the packages and services sound good  and they are when they're running consistently  they're not very solid  they're very tight now due to a new 'policy' recently of only able to credit any downtime you have by the hour due to the computers and how they log reimbursements  so basically if you're a day without internet you're probably going to get a couple of quid  if that  which is pretty bad considering how other companies give you good gestures of good will after loss of service etc... so they're starting to become a bit greedy really and that's very off putting. they need to reduce their prices a lot if they really want to compete and be the best out there because when you're paying so much for a broadband that's not really all that stable most of the time  it's pretty bad and even so they are still over priced. generally the experience is good but it's not good to validate the prices they charge by any means  other than you do get a good speed  maybe different area's have different experiences . i guarantee that less is more for them and they would have a ton of extra customers had they have had lower prices but i don't think they would do that because they seem to be getting a little more money greedy than anything else really from what they told me yesterday about their new reimbursement policy  i just thought that was terrible.  customer services depends who you get  i called a guy recently and explained about how my internet had been dropping and cutting out a lot lately  he pretty much said to me that there was no record of it  basically calling me a liar  yet trust me it had been dropping out  he went on to say how they don't reimburse wi-fi loss  understandable  but i explained that it wasn't just wi-fi because all the connections went down  including my pc which is wired  he pretty much denied it and it was a complete wasted phone call  however a guy i spoke to later when it happened again was much more helpful  but he told me about the new policy about reimbursement where they have brought in a system where they can only give the exact downtime they see  no little gestures or anything  nothing and as mentioned above  i think that's pretty bad as it feels you're not really valued as a customer and they only give you back what they have to by law basically  which is what i mean about how they treat you as a customer. getting through to them isn't the hardest but it is a bit of a pain going through the system  this could be much easier  specially with the password crap on the automated system  and i've always had advisers in the uk too thankfully  nothing against the people abroad but they don't understand most of the time and we need this of course for these kind of things  so it's pretty touch and go really but all round the customer services haven't been too bad really.  to be fair  i don't think the uk have a very good outstanding broadband provider so there's no competition for these companies to give best prices and services as virgin have the speeds and strength but as mentioned above  so they don't need to be any better to us yet other companies might have a bit better service but don't have the speeds we often need for things such as sky go  netflix etc.. and wi-fi strength in the home. soon as a good broadband provider offers this at an affordable price for everyone  they are going to be soaring above the rest and all these companies such as virgin will just fall and that's what they need. it seems a shame that the uk hasn't got a solid leading internet provider like we do with the phone services  such as o2 for example who are brilliant for 99% of people when it comes to everything and have been for many years. internet providers need to take note and someone out there needs to spice up the competition for these people. i hope this has helped :- ",2.0

2381,no ratings to award as the most incompetent company in media history. impossible to contact even head office have not responded to my letter of gross misconduct and extremely dangerous practice leaving exposed cable on a public pavement! which incidentally they trespassed on my land to weave the cable through in order to provide broadband to my neighbours! nothing like blatant cheek! last resort now contact cisas again and local tabloids this bunch of cowboys left cable on top of my garden   dug up my flagging and just left rubble. no one is taking responsibility for the siting of the junction box outside my home passing the buck from virgin to oldham council ping pong! could it be due to payments involved with la? for allowing siting of virgin junction boxes?? all abdicating responsibility. absolutely atrocious lying company told me i could landline with virgin however engineer stated never in a month of sundayâs as no provision! thank god i didnât go ahead with their installation not that it was feasible anyway according to the engineer! too dangerous after leaving exposed cables lying in view and obstructing pavement.,3.0

2384,worst possible services in all spectrum of services provided by virgin. tv offers nothing special at all while it is expensive compared to others. their broadband is the biggest lie  it doesn't work upstairs when hub is downstairs. the price goes up frequently and customer service assistants would lie. they don't value customers and their loyalty at all. hell hath no fury if you want to cancel  didn't think twice before coming out of contract paying oddless fees. worst service provider from my experience.,1.0

2387,the worst customer support you are ever likely to experience,2.0
2388,"i made a mistake of signing up virgin for all the services at home i.e. phone  broadband  and tv with  premium packages for all. virgin is known to not to have content for the tv and that's why their tv packages costs the most. however  i thought their fibre broadband must be good and reliable. unfortunately  it is worst of the three core services they provide. for us  broadband going down is a weekly affair very much like their outsourced customer support services. and for now it is down from last 4 days and the earliest an engineer can visit to look at the issue is one week wait. there is no guarantee it will be fixed. it's only the visit to look at the issue. why virgin sign up so many customers if they can not support and make customer wait for weeks to fix? broadband is a basic service and outsourced customer support of virgin outside uk thinks this is a premium service which should be used only on a need basis. calling virgin customer support is such a useless experience and waste of time because team is unskilled and have no understanding or appreciation of the issues you are facing. they will make false promises and there is no one in the uk to talk to you. so when you are in trouble  it is like talking to a wall.  in summary  if you are looking for media services  remove virgin from your list to even consider. i am and will move to other provider as soon as i feel a bit better. in spite of telling my medical condition and being a premium services customer of virgin their is no effort to retain and fix the issue i am facing.",1.0
2389,i am annoyed with the way virgin media as company forces you into their bureaucratic process. it takes so long just to get a date for an engineer to visit!!! i have had to phone now 6 times and still no date. i have to wait for the assigned order manager to be at their desk before they will process my order!! i think they have taken the phone order process from a communist country's telecom company. what an awful company to deal with after the order has been placed.,1.0
2390,"i am extremely dissatisfied with the way that the company deals with everything. it is not the staff that i have experienced problems with  it is the general bureaucracy of the company itself. it is very hard to get in touch and it takes a long time to go through all the vertiffication process to actually get to the request. i have made 2 trips around london in trying to return my broadband and i still need to get a new packaging and do it again because last time i didn't receive the post sticker. i am definitely going to wow my experience  sorry.",2.0
2391,absolutely disgusting company to deal with. took up the offer and was given installation date of 30th september. engineer arrived and said only been instructed to install tv and broadband not phone as oversubscribed in area. virgin obviously didn't care to inform me of this prior to sending engineer out for the install. rang them as the engineer left and was passed from department to department till finally spoke to preinstall dept. told me there was no problems with being oversubscribed and would arrange for an engineer to come back out on the 4th of october to install phone. in the meantime the tv and broadband kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the service. today the engineer came out only to repeat what the first engineer said on the 30th... instead of connecting phone  reconnected broadband and tv and commented on how badly virgin wee managing the install. 2 agreed installs later rang again to be passed from pillar to post only to be told they were going to charge â£55 p m due to not being able to install phone and this was the cost of the tv and broadband package i had been put on without the phone. swiftly told them to stick it as was their fault didn't inform me sooner and due to sending engineers out twice to hook up phone only to fail to deliver. told me if wasn't happy to cancel. told him i wanted to put formal complaint to which i was told i couldnt if i was going to csncel...so it was a choice between cough up more money for a reduced service or suck it up and complain which they would probably do naff all about. went through to cancellations who then told me it would take them 30 days to refund me. absolute farce of a company...over 4 hours wasted on the phone and to top it off lost our number we were porting over from sky. no apology...not one advisor accepted responsibility just kept passing the buck and if i dared to speak against them cut me off or transferred to another random department. brought back memories of why i left in the first place years ago. hope this company dies a horrible death will never be taking out any of their services again...,2.0

2394,absolutely appalling  paying for 100mb service only getting 3 to 4mb spoke to 7 people on their help lines  told by one of their support technicals that he will not be helping me  had a support technician out who managed to cut if the wifi trying to fix the problem  had a 2 hour long phonecard resulting in one of their operators insulting me and refusing to help  do not use virgin media as a broadband provider.,1.0
2395,not even worth 1 * twice in few months i had their equipment broken. im paying 36 a month for the most awful service in the uk. takes ages till the engineer comes around and the 2nd time they didn't even came  when i came across with them on phone they hanged up. don't recomend to anyone,2.0
2396,from the day we got virgin media we have had broadband that is quick when it works  around 75mbps  but on an daily and sometimes hourly basis we have to restart the modem as either the signal vanishes or the server stops responding. if you are in the room directly above the modem  old house  timber floors  you can never get a signal and have to rely on a wifi extension plug.  the tv package is ok but at around 65 quid a month it's not worth it. better get a 17mbps package that works with another supplier than bother with virgin. when you complain they can normally send an engineer no sooner than five days later. if you work from home it's a nightmare.,3.0
2397,this is possibly the worst isp i've ever dealt with. i recently signed up for virgin media business as i operate with a few small companies a variety of servers. they are awful the contractor came in and shoved the box on the end didn't test it and signed it off as complete. he left a mess behind and behaved totally unprofessionally. tried to resolve this with customer service and so far no luck been waiting for days have had around 100 hours down time evethough they're contracted for 24 hours down time. their foreign call centres are impossible to deal with. while the companies professionalism is unequalled in its poor quality. i've also been informed there is likely to be problems with my static ips due to more faults at their end. i work in a technology role in my main full time job and while i work at a company and have any say what so ever i will never  ever use virgin media services again.,1.0
2398,as a student me and my flatmates needed good speed and  unlimited download so we decided to get virgin 200mb bundle for 12 months. for the first month it was super  me and my flatmate were getting top speed and no issues  however on the 17th sep there was a storm and it caused issues with our internet. 2 days later virgin claimed to have fixed this issue but we noticed no fix. our wifi was mostly 'connected  no internet' and my pc which was wired via ethernet would go to 0.9mb s every minute making it impossible to play online and difficult to browse. ive called virgin up and the first 2 calls they told me to reset the router  factory reset it  forget and reconnect to no prevail  they insisted it wasnt anything on their end. a technician got sent out and they switched the router  the technician even apologised  saying that there were issues on their  virgins  end while reinstalling. nothing changed and since then they have told me to do the same stuff over and over again and told me they wouldn't send a technician out. its been almost 2 weeks and they have said numerous times they would call me back which they never did. i do not recommend virgin to anyone as their customer service is unhelpful.,1.0

2422,"on 8 june this year i applied to virgin media for a bundle 100. after four weeks of wondering why there was no activity and making many phone calls i was informed that i needed documentation from the property owner approving my request. this was done and sent to virgin media in july.. i was informed that it would take several weeks to organise so my installation was booked for 22 august. on the appointed day i waited for the installer. he arrived late and refused to install the cable modem where i requested. i live in a two-storey stone building in the modem was installed in a diagonal corner of the base level. however when he set boxes up he informed me that one of the boxes was not working so he would have to replace it. he also installed a tivo box which got an error message. he informed me that i should keep turning the tivo box on and off and eventually it would work. at this point he left.imagine my surprise when four days later i was told  on my fifth call  that the error message that i was receiving from the tivo box meant that the box was broken and would have to be replaced. i was also informed at this stage that because the wi-fi box had been replaced i had no internet because the mac address could not be changed by people that i could talk to. however it had been referred to someone and it should be done within three days. this took me to monday  28 august.my new tivo box arrived in the mail. i installed and however it did not work either. several telephone calls later the it support people informed me that there was some problem in the system and they would have to book a call to 5 september. that being the earliest call they had available.on 5 september i waited at home looking forward to having my internet bundle working. at 7 pm i rang virgin to ask where the installer was. i was informed that the appointment had been cancelled by virgin because they'd been having system issues and they thought that my have fixed my problem. by now i was up to more than 20 hours of phone charges on a mobile call. and somewhat surprisingly virgin media staff were starting to object to my language and frustration.by now my virgin media farce had been running for three months and i still had no internet bundle. after several more hours of attempted support on the phone i was informed that a visit by another install would be required to figure out what the problem was. however  it would be september 22 before they could have someone arrive.at this stage my partner and i decided that the farce had gone on long enough. we would cancel this attempt. however even that was not to be the simple exercise that we expected. over an hour later we still had people trying to convince us that virgin media was either not incompetent or not malicious. however they finally took our word for it that we were irretrievably opposed to ever having anything to do with virgin media ever again. interestingly the young lady would not give receive reference number or any other information that would allow us to refer back to the discussion we were having with her. however she did make the comment during this call that virgin media egregious behaviour over the previous three months should not be held against us  and that there should be no charge applied to our account. she even put us on hold for five minutes while she went away and confirmed this.imagine my surprise when on 18 september i received a bill from virgin media to services rendered. so here is my review: if you are so filled with self-loathing that you wish to be messed around and treated as trash for several months virgin media may be a company you wish to be involved with. i personally will go out of my way to inform any person asking any questions of my opinions regarding broadband and media supply in the uk to avoid this group  and i personally will attempt to make sure that i never again have anything to do with this group. oh and by the way i am taking the matter of the final bill to the ombudsman.",1.0

2429,"this package offered as three months trial period and there was a problem setting up our broadband and the rest of the services  i called virgin media on 15 august to enquire about the end date for this 3 months trial period. as i received an email from virgin on 12 july asking for feedback about your services within first month i thought the service has gone live on 12 june  therefore in this conversation i asked whether the service went live on 12 june and this was confirmed by the customer service representative. i then called on 6 september 2017 and requested for cancellation of this contract and i was told by a customer services representative that i need to speak to a member of national homebuildersâ team to cancel this service. the call was transferred to this department and after being around 20 minutes on the line  an automated message played stating that due to technical issues my call will not be answered today and i will be contacted with this regard. since i was given 12 september as a final day of our three months trial period  i then contacted virgin on 11 september to clarify that i do not want to proceed with this broadband and i would like it to be cancelled. i talked to a customer services representative in the evening of 12 september and to my surprise  i was told that this could now be cancelled by a member of customer services department  although i was told that this only can be dealt with by national home buildersâ team. i was then told that our cancellation deadline was 8 september and not 12 september and therefore we are liable to cancellation charges and this service only can be cancelled with a 30 day notice. i requested for our conversation on 15 august to be listened to confirm what i was told  but david the representative refused to do this and stated that i have called late and i am liable for the cancellation charges.",1.0

2431,big warning people   do not get virgin broadband   it's been a month and they have not resolved my broadband problem . i have called every day   sent complaint letters   been told by their own technician that they are taking on too many connections and don't have enough cables   so their engineer keep on taking off my cable from their cabinet. i am sick off them   and would you believe that to get rid of them i have to wait for 3 months and 5 technician visits or i get charged for disconnection,1.0
2432,a catastrophic introduction to virgin media broadband. installation team arrived on the agreed day but apparently cannot connect us to the cable in the road outside. apologetic  but went away again without making it at all clear what would happen next . phoned customer services to make the point that  apart from establishing that said cable existed  the sales team had asked me absolutely no questions in relation to the practicalities of the installation. thus they are unable to fulfil the contract that i have signed  due in my view  to prioritising sales over service. the customer service team informed me that they have booked another installation appointment for 9 days time  without checking first whether this was feasible for me or not . this has left a huge problem as  in good faith  we had cancelled our existing internet provider contract and consequently will be without internet for 5 or 6 days. this is disastrous as our work within the public examination system relies on accessing the internet at home. if i were virgin i would already be thinking of waiving fees or of financial redress  but no hint of this beyond the well-rehearsed apologies that staff learn at their training sessions. i had to make all these follow up enquiries myself  no-one called emailed texte for in excess of  6 hours with any info as to next steps after the initial failure. it's quite clear that lightly regulated competitive telecoms does not provide consumers with good service. nationalisation could not be any worse  and would almost certainly be better....,1.0

2435,i've had virgin broadband for six months  has worked well until about two weeks ago  gradually getting stickier. three days ago it stopped working. quite hard to get to speak to the right person. first of all they said they'd get an engineer out  in four days!  then that it was an 'area fault' and they were working hard to correct it  finally got an assistant who said that basically there were too many people online and all the channels were full! they were planning for it to be fixed in a week's time! it took five calls to get to that stage  and many minutes spent in a voice jail trying to get through to an actual person each time i called. they were all very apologetic but gave several different stories and i don't know who to believe. luckily i'm moving house in a few days but i am so disappointed in the lack of real explanation. i used to think that virgin fibre was a sort of gold standard - not any more. i am equally disappointed that it has failed so catastrophically and the appalling customer service. not the people  but the system.,2.0

2455,"not fit for purpose ! virgin media is without a doubt the worst isp i have come across since the dial up days. they are in short breaching regulations daily with knowingly selling faulty services to customers which is ongoing at the moment. if your considering their service ask about the known fault affecting all static ip customers and ask when it will be resolved. the answer undoubtedly is they do not know which i have been quoted for over 40 days.  here are the other items which are deceiving in their contracts and sales pitch. 1.	its 24 working hours sla not 24 hours even if you are a 24 7 company from the point of the faultâ¦. this is actually 3 days of potential complete service loss as quoted from helpdesk engineer on 13 09 2017 2.	they are presently selling business service at 300mb when they are universally aware of an ongoing issue with providing static ips resulting in a 90% degrade in service. they will be quite happy to offer you 50% off your bill if you raise this with htem for a 90% loss of service though. clearly  they are as bad at mathematics as they are at providing an internet service.  3.	if you are fortunate enough to be online then in short you will be lucky to see 20% of the speed which they quote you on the sales pitch. with that in mind why not ask them when you call what guarantee of service speed they have. the answer to this is none so in effect you can be paying for 300 and getting 10 and wonât be able to get out of the contract.  4.	their ts and cs avoid any liability beyond the cost of the package so indemnity and loss of earnings is not covered. they are in fact directly waived in the contract which any company worth its weight would not have to put in a contract in the first place. 4. if you are fortunate enough to get through to the helpdesk  be prepared for upwards of 25 mins on hold  you will be even more fortunate to not be disconnected when trying to raise a fault or complaint. i was disconnected for 2 solid hours each time i tried to reach complaints repartment to have my issue resolved.  in short  their service is shambolic  we have been hard down 3 times in the first month. their staff are inept at dealing with even the most basic of issues and their contact is basically to tie you in as they are as per above openly aware they have massive network issues. really this is actually beyond the requirement for the regulator  knowingly selling faulty goods or services is actually fraud in my opinion.",2.0

2466,generally there are no problems with the broadband but once something goes wrong it takes days to get fixed....at 11:30 at night the internet just got disconnected and after contacting the customer service all they said is that it will be fixed next day by 4 pm. they never said what the problem was. at 8pm i tried to contact them and the automated service told me it will be fixed next day at 12 :30 but somehow i highly doubt that. terrible customer service they cant be bothered to send an email telling us why or what they are doing to fix the issue  i have to keep chaing them. even though the distruptions dont happen often once they do it take days to fix it  i had similar problem with the same provider before as well so i can say from personal experience that its not that uncommon,2.0

2543,we have emailed on several occasions with our issues and they have never responded. we have made phone calls  notes have been put on our account  for a return call and guess what? we've had no call  back! they have the monopoly and they know it! you renew your contract at the end of the year and then low and behold  in january you get a letter saying your bill is going up again but only by a small amount and everything has to go up apparently. certainly won't waste our time contacting these people again. the sooner we can find an alternative supplier the better! very poor customer service and one very satisfied customer on this occasion.,2.0

2744,i would not use virgin media unless i had no choice. we are renting and my landlord will not allow us to install a regular phone line so we have to use virgin media for broadband and phone calls. it is shockingly expensive  and they keep upping the price. one month i was charged â£135 for phone calls abroad. i had asked if there was any way to avoid the astronomical fees for calls to the us and  after about 30 mins with customer services  they concluded there was not. after this bill someone else at customer services told me i should have paid yet another monthly add-on to avoid these charges. they give conflicting information  the charges have increased since signing a contact with them  and it took 2 weeks to get broadband turned on  in which time we missed the olympics. my kids were gutted  especially when we passed the billboards featuring usain bolt  saying how fast virgin is! broadband is not reliable and cuts out. i would strongly recommend a different provider.,1.0

""we have another  <expletive> one who wants something for nothing. can you please talk to him as he wants to talk to a manager.  she comes back on the line to say she had found a busy manger that would take my call.  at this point i was totally shocked and speechless. my wife next to me could also here the comment.  so a guy called david merrilees introduced himself to my by saying he was the customer service manager and he understood i was wanting an exstension on my bill. i said yes that's right. so he went on saying that he can't do anything for me and i'll have to wait 2 days until i payed my bill. i said to him that they have helped me before and why not now? he replied by saying he doesn't need to answer my question and he has nothing more to say to me. so i asked to speak to another manager. he replied no i can't do that today. i then asked ""could you put me through to complaints department. he replied no can't do that for you today.  by this time my wife took over from me. he was so rude and  aggressive towards my wife. him and his colleague were both laughing  in the background. my wife said she is going to put the phone down and call back to speak to the complaints department. he said. i've now put a total block on your account. so you won't be able to call out to anyone. we did call back and we did speak to the complaints department and we raised a complaint. i don't think the guy believed us by the way we were treated intill he listened to to the recording of the whole conversation. he apologised several times and told us this will be passed on  immediately to there complaints manager. he also  gave us the 2 day extension. i asked if i could have a follow up in regards to the two colleges. he replied yes i would get a phone call with information on what's happening to them.  please guys stay well clear of virgin media.they are  appalling rude and  threatening",2.0

2826,"hi all  i'd like to explain my situation and how i was abused and trapped by virgin media. this testimony is for your help  for you to know how things are treated at vm when service faulted. i moved in my new home on the 13th of january. a technician came to install all he services and everything was working... for some days.  5 or 6 days later  the internet connection faulted. i contacted the team and they send some technicians.engineers to look after the problem. at the begining of february they called me to inform that the technician who was supposed to come at my house won't because it is a problem of network  cable in the street  and postponed the appointment to the 12 of march  more than a month later . at this stage i was very irritated because i need internet for my work so i had to suscibe more 4g data from my mobile provider. in the meantime the have debited 92â£ from my account for the service from 13 january - 12 march  so for 5 days of working services. i asked several times for reimbursement but nothing. so the 12 march  after almost 2 months of waiting i was impatient to use my internet connect but guess what ? it was still not working. i have contacted the fault service team 2 times and they were not able to give me an answer why. the connect me to the construction team who told me they will contact me within 2 days and that the problem should be fixed betewwen 2 - 8 weeks  8 weeks again to wait!!!!! . i was exhausted and wanted to cancel to go at bt or sky  so i called the customer services who connected me to the cancellation team. there i explained the situation and say that i wanted to cancel my subsciption without early terminate fees because the were not able to provide the service.  oh yes  the funny thing is as the internet defaulted after 5 days and the time they send a technician to my home it was too late  more than 14 days  to cancel without fees. so the guy told me that the constuction team will contact me within 2 days and after this call if i have to wait too  more than 2 weeks  i will be able to cancel without fees. i asked him to confirm that by sendinbg me an email. he accepted but guess what ? i never recived it. 5 days later  of course nobody from the construction team contacted me  i contacted the service and someone said that the problem will be fixed on 24th of march. wahou ! finally a date of availability of the service i am paying for but can't use and the 24th of march i think you have already guess that it was not working!!! i am more exhausted than irritated now. on monday i have again contacted the team  they said the construction team will contact me within 2 days. the didnt. today i have contacted the team  the said me the construction team will contact me today. again and again  the same answer and no internet. so finally i decided to contact the complaint team. i chatted with zoe  who were very unpleasant. she told me that i have to wait 7 more working days. i said that i cannot wait anymore as i am waiting for almost 3 months now. so as your colleague told me before i wanted to cancel without early terminate fees. and what was my surprise when she told me than it wasn't possible that i have to pay more than 100â£ for terminate my bundle!!!! i feel very trapped today. vm are taking my money  they dont provide the service and if i want to terminate i have to give more money. is that the kinf of treatment we have to bear with this company?  i don't know what to do anymore. i continue to pay for the service  i am paying more and more 4g data from my mobile provider  and i cannot switch vm from a honest and professional provider. i hope this testominy could help those who wondering if they should go at vm. for information in my service status it is written that everything works. so dont be abused like me and run away!",2.0

2840,i was with virgin media for something like 20 years  and i had a pretty good  though expensive  service for most of this time. all this changed on the 17th november 2016 when my landline stopped working. after virgin looked into the problem they said they would have to dig the road up and this would take three months. i was promised the service would be restored on 17th february  but nothing happened. i was then told it would take afurther two months. i complained to the regulator and obtained some compensation and refunds. i decided to leave virgin and change to john lewis broadband  who got the new system working pretty quickly. a few days later some contractors for virgin turned up to dig up the road! i couldn't see any point in this and persuaded them to go away. virgin media have been totally incompetent and completely useless since the problem appeared. it is very unlikely i will have any dealings with them again.,1.0

2920,i hate virgin media. do not use under any circumstances. terrible customer service  paying for 30mb s a month for broadband and telephone. been getting less than 1mb s in the evening  and tonight it reached an all time low of 0.1 mb s  300 times less than what they promised  and the telephone lines been down for months as well. tried to contact virgin  but everytime had to wait over 30 minutes  and then they hang you up. i am pretty sure its illegal to falsly advertise your product. someone with resources need to sue them. when finally reached the support team by going into a virgin shop  they told me my internet was an area problem  which they say will take 6 month to fix. and they refuse to compensate. do not use. do not use.,2.0
2921,i have not yet come across a company that offers its customers such bad and inadequate customer service. a day prior to the installation date we were notified that the installation cannot take place due to permission needed from the council  this is unacceptable and has result in us having no internet and telephone line for 3 weeks. i would not recommend switching over to virgin  they are unhelpful  unreliable and a company that has no adequate processes in place to ensure they stick to their commitment dates. singing up with them 3 weeks prior to the installation date  would have giving virgin enough time to stick by their commitment date  and gained the necessary permissions required.,1.0
2922,i hate virgin. they hang up on u all the time. constantly transferring you to somebody else. they are charging me for an account which is fictional yeah fictional and sending threatening letters affecting my credit ratings. i waited over 2 months for them to set up virgin in our right address. many pounds spent talking to foreigners who can't understand english. my hubby on phone now as they still trying to bill us. we were supposed to get sim cards that didn't appear. and we demanding to cancel everything as we hate them and he is trying to stop him from doing so,2.0

2997,i had a call from virgin media offering me a great deal  i had been with sky for 27 years and never had any issues. i joined virgin and the install of 4 x tivo boxes  phone line and broadband happened on 22 october. virgin told me i would not be without any of my services and it would be an easy switch. boy oh boy  what a mistake i have made. firstly the install engineer said there was a fault on the phone line and he needed to get a dedicated engineer out and said one would be with us on 28 october  i took day off work and no engineer arrived  despite getting a text the night before saying they would be coming. i thought someone would get in touch to apologize and explain  but nothing  not a dickie bird. the tivo box in the kitchen was taking 25 - 30 mins to start up  after less than two weeks the tivo box in the bedroom started giving an overheating message. the broadband just dropped off all the time and if you rebooted the router  it takes around 25 mins to reset and start up again. so after a month  i called virgin and yes the guy i spoke to was apologetic and said he would send a 'senior engineer out and sort out the issues. he also said he could sort the broadband issue out from his end  how? do they deliberately withhold your signal until you complain? the engineer arrived on 10 december  replaced the tivo boxes in the bedroom and kitchen and said the phone will be ok but he has to do something at the exchange. replacement tivo box in kitchen was just as bad  taking ages to start up. broadband not much better and still no phone. with christmas coming i left it. i called at the start of january threatening to leave as they were not delivering on what i signed up to. a third engineer arrived on saturday 10 jan and said that the wrong phone socket had been wired up. we now have a working phone. i signed up for 12 months in october 2016 and i will be going back to sky as soon as i get out of the contract with virgin.,2.0

3001,"the virgin broadband service was generally quite bad  even though according to their checks  prior to my subscribing to them   the service to the flat was supposedly excellent. the reasons why i found it terrible are as follows: 1. the broadband signal frequently dropped out - multiple times per day - which was extremely irritating to say the least.2. the hub was in the living room  and when the broadband signal was available  internet access was fine in the living room. however  there was often no wifi signal elsewhere in the flat despite the flat being small and my devices being no more than 5 metres from the hub  i found this out only because my mobile data was being drained so quickly! .3. the download speeds were far slower than i was led to believe by the virgin team. periodically  when i found it unbearable  they would ""boost"" things for me remotely  but the benefit was short-lived.  on the plus side  !!!   i found that their telephone customer services were pretty good  unlike bt! . given all the above issues  i had to phone them multiple times. everyone i spoke to was friendly and tried to help. unfortunately  the broadband service itself leaves much to be desired. to date  i have used a number of internet providers. i would not go back to virgin.",2.0

3024,"virgin ratings based on all the things you are looking for. package sales - goodbroadband speed - good however as i soon came to realise the additional add ons  automated phone system - they love to go through full background history check and pressing numbers  before you come anywhere close to get to the right department. so yes it is far too long winded and says thanks after every button you press which soon becomes a pest. so make sure your not in a rush and are patient and mentally prepare yourself for the call maybe a few stretches would be good release some tension. customer services - the worst on the planet full of fake answers. there favourite line is ""will look into this for you and call you back"" but after numerous calls i've had and the call backs i've requested i'd say a good 1 10 call you back. aswell as that you can not always understand what there saying as it's another outsource company who are given guidelines to follow who actually offer no help apart from what you already know. engineers - well upon installation you get advised a date which is great. so i booked a friday off work to be told there going to be late. however 3pm they turn up due to the size of the job they couldn't start so a wasted day for myself and adios to a days annual leave. best part is when they turn up and don't even tell you there leaving until their 30 minutes down the road on the friday. sales - sell you a great deal like â£100 off your total costs. which was said at the time your first bill and part of your 2nd bill will be free which is great news. but you guessed it i got a bill for 60 quid the first month to which i raised the issue and i was advised this will be sorted for the next 2 months bills. i generally can't even remember their excuse that day guys sorry. however the 2nd month you guessed it i got another bill of you guessed it 60 quid after being promised this won't happen. clearly they don't give a toss about your issue they just advise you what you want to hear. their is clearly within virgin obvious miscommunication between sales and customer service but after 3 months we finally came to a conclusion. i had to pay a one off fee of 70 quid and ended up getting my 100 quid by stopping the line rental for 10 months at 17.99.  they also say free netflix for 6 months so any normal human being would think it comes free with the virgin box however doesn't tell you  you need to call them and set up your own account. nor any paperwork giving you a guide when they sell you these deals of how to set up these add ons. so once again i end up speaking to the customer service team to find out what code you need to do it so another military option going round the houses within virgin to find the right person to speak to before being toldto phone netflix and doing your own install with the pin they provide you.  today christmas day i might add - router stuck on green flashing lights. i phone virgin they advise there's nothing they can do soi am stuck without wireless until the 28 12 when an engineer is available which is what i was advised. but don't worry virgin customer service gods never fail. until i phoned backto see if there was anything they could do over the phone as it's christmas they said an engineers will be appearing on the 31 12???? i was just told the 28 12 so the conversation once again turned sour. so that's me without virgin all over the festive season lucky me and thank you virgin for a great year. i hope you are making many resolutions for 2017 that's that folks you really couldn't make it up i have had it with virgin i wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to virgin i would steer clear of these shambles. utter utter disgrace. if any company needs a top down reshuffle and audited its this shower of pony regardstom",2.0

3054,don't get virgin!!! installation was supposed to have occurred a week ago. despite having had 3 weeks to check if external cabling was function  they left it till day when they cut my existing phone line and broadband. a car was parked on a manhole preventing them from feeding cable through  so contractor left and that was the last i heard of them. i have spent a week calling virgin repeatedly. they have not managed to call me once to inform when or if installation will ever occur. still not clear. why cut my phoneline and internet when they could easily have checked cabling before installation  then absolutely no urgency to resolve. the contracts with external contrators obviously favour smooth installation so if there is any problem contractor can just dump job with no penalties. customer service is designed to ensure you can never speak to anyone with any authority to do anything except to say you have to wait for 48 hours for something or nothing to happen  nothing in my case . they are not allowed to call out so if you get a direct line to relevant dept rather than passing round vast numbers of call centres  you are charged for phone call. in all virgin milk customers who have no problems  but provide zero service in those cases where there are problems. that is the business model.,2.0
3055,abysmally poor. i never even got my broadband connected in the end. they sent an engineer  only to find there was no line outside my house. i was told this would take two engineers and i would have to wait 12 weeks. i then called and asked to cancel my account. the incredibly incompetent people they have answering their phones promised that two engineers would be sent the friday of that week to do an install. i took half the day off work  unpaid  to ensure i would be there. they sent one engineer who was unable to connect the the line. he queried this and  yep  a 12 week wait for the two engineers. at this point i cancelled my account and they had the sheer nerve to ask for a â£240 early disconnection charge. for a service that was never even connected! thankfully  i persuaded them to drop this charge. i then went with a different provider and was online a week later. since then  virgin have sent out two engineers  who were sent away   contacted me as a 'valued former customer' and  the day before yesterday  sent me a text to expect more engineers tomorrow! to do work on my non-existent line! this company is just a joke. the people on the phones lie to you and don't know what they're talking about. the woman i spoke with about getting a line connected  who was supposed to be organising the engineers  asked me if i had a green light on my router. well  no  because it wasn't connected to anything! just avoid them completely.,2.0

3086,i've joined virgin media by phone 6 months ago. when i joined they told me it was a 12 month contract and would only be 48 pound per month. i never received any letters until 6 months later when i was already joined and the letter stated i was in a 18 month contract and cost would go up to 85 pound after 6 months. i rang up immediately and told them i want to cancel now there trying to say i owe them 865 for leaving. virgin media is a rip off and are not explaining there contracts proplerly nor are they giving people there cooling off period which is required by law. the goverment are fully aware of what they are doing because i've heard a lot of people telling me they had same problem. it's 2016 and the world is never going move on unless someone stops all this corruption and stop letting bussiness like virgin rip people off. never join virgin ive moved to sky and i've got a better package for â£31 pound a months explained in writing doing everything by law and really there for there customers virgin is just ripping them off and should be shut down and there customer service is ridiculous couldn't believe what they were like on phone. trust me people please keep away from virgin you will regret          god bless,2.0

3088,i have been with virgin media for over 20 years. last year i upgraded the broadband to 200 mbps and it worked fine until recently. we had a letter stating to improve services in our area everything would go off for a day. when it came back on my broadband has been reduced from 200 mbps to 10.50 mbps without them telling me this would happen. i called the customer service who informed me that this has happened due to the number of customers in my area ! they have cut most users down from 200 to 20. they gave me a â£25 credit for november. i have to ring every month to get this reduction of my bill. they said they hope to have customers paying for 200 mbps back up to this rate in february 2017. if you don't ring or don't notice then you don't get the refund. they are apparently not legally bound to tell customers if and when they reduce the speed so  check your speed regularly. they do not care what they do so long as they get away with it.,1.0
3089,i've been a virgin customer for over 15 years & seen it slip & slip. now i carnt take it no more im having to reboot the router 4 to 5 times a day.. & when i have complained to them about it they seam to think this is acceptable ? i'm going to be changing services after there engineer comes out & isn't resolved on the 1st of december,1.0

3092,a terrible service. if you have to ring customer service you just get passed around. you never speak to the same person twice. they do not seem to have the knowledge to solve problems. i was left without broadband for over a week after moving. i rang for a total of over three hours in separate phone calls. bills seem to be made up every month. email service is slow. if there is an alternative use it.,2.0

3094,i am absolutely fuming with virgin media.  we signed up to be installed on 15th october 2016  to be told when they arrived that some of the wires when laid in the street must have been crushed  so ok  we wait for that to be sorted.  new installation date 2nd november  they arrive  still the road hasnt been repaired so away they go again  this is after having time off work  numerous lengthy phone calls to virgin who have some awful people working for them  sorry but they do!!! we were then given another date of 29th november  so more time off work  to find out when they arrive that the road problem still hasnt been sorted.  are virgin seriously having a laugh with us!!! grrrrr angry is not the word.  i demand to speak to a manager  who promises to ring back tomorrow  like that will happen  we have been promised numerous phone calls back and got nothing  is there really any professional people working at virgin that can actually sort queries out.  i am so disappointed in the overall service..it is unbelievable for such a high named company.  i am sure richard branson would not be impressed.  so if anyone is thinking of getting virgin media..just beware the overall service is beyond zero and very unhelpful and unreliable staff at the end of the phone!!!!,1.0
3095,"i had such a bad experience with virgin after being a loyal broadband customer for 4 years  i have just had enough. the service they provide is spotty and the customer service is rude and unaccommodating. how can a company not take notes when you ask them to cancel your account???? i now have an â£120 charge of internet & phone that i didn't use?? i thought if i just talk to them like a human being that would be enough  i mean how can you refuse to give a refund and not even be bothered about getting the money from the person using their service  they would get the same amount of money it's just them to caring and hiding behind corporate policy. i got passed around to at least 10 different people in different departments  and then you get transferred to the 'bully' who has been trained to brow beat you into submission by not caring about you in the slightest. they don't even listen to you they just wait for their turn to say  no  we are keeping your hard earned money just because it's against a policy that i have never seen nor signed or agreed too. well guess what... it is not my policy to give money to anyone that has not earned it.corporations should have a responsibility to do the right thing when situations arise where human decency is needed. we all need to vote with our money when a company steps out of line and just starts caring about the money more than the customer. would you want to give money to company like this??... cause i wouldn't.. never again will i use any of their services.the thing about virgin is they make you pay 20% extra for what you think is going to be a much better service  but this is false. i thought that as a virgin customer they would go the extra mile to provide great or even ok customer service. this is false too. virgin spends all this money on advertising telling us they are a certain way when they are not! i mean when i left utility warehouse years ago they were way nicer and they are a small company in comparison.i have now changed to bt broadband and they are really great. i had an issue which the customer service bent over backwards to help and make sure everything was ok.",1.0
3096,i'm not the type to ever leave a review  let alone a bad one  but unfortunately i feel i need to now. do not pick virgin as a provider.i have been let down in a variety of ways... over charger 3 times  huge lack of customer service  let alone the fact the speed of my service is crap  takes around 1 hour and a half to download anything. pathetic. virgin media you should be ashamed of yourself.,2.0

3098,i cannot even give virgin a 1 star rating! so to begin - virgin installed cables throughout the entire village - rep calls round and explains the 200mps broadband speeds i can achieve and the costs - all sounds good so i sign up - tuesday virgin installed - thursday ring up to find out why we still haven't got internet access and problem sorted - saturday kids complaining that ps4 games were rubbish and lagging and upstairs no wi-fi on laptop. so ring virgin who explain all the devices need to sign in to 5g not 2g.  so away we all go to resign in. only 1 mobile could sign in and get 150mps speeds  xbox could find 5g but wi-fi signal couldn't travel upstairs so couldn't sign in. ps4 does not support 5g!!!  nobody mentioned this to us during the sales pitch and advice from the engineer.  so after further conversations about boosters and wiring all the devices up we decided to return to our trusted bt service which gave us better speeds and worked all devices throughout the house.  so be warned  if you want the speeds promised them make sure you have the right mobile phone  gaming consoles and don't mind wiring running through your house!,2.0
3099,"i have agreed to switch from current broadband provider to virgin as there were many letters from virgin promising 200 mbps internet fibre optic connection and good offers.  but  i came to know from my friend in the next lane that they had lot of issues with virgin connection as they failed to enable a connection for 2 weeks and informed that it will take another 8 weeks to enable a connection in to the house as it will require a council permission. i called virgin atleast 5 times as i did not want to face the same issue. even the day before the virgin sales team said 99% there are no issues for connecting the broadband as there are other properties in my lane  who has broadband connection. on the day  engineer informed me that it will take 2 further days to investigate and may take extra time to get council permission. the worst part was  they disconnected my phone  tv and boardband with existing provider.  this is irresponsible from virgin as they did not foresee the issues. i had to be on phone for hours to stay with current broadband provider. i suggest you only opt for virgin if your house had a connection from the company before. if not  i am very sure that the sales team will try to sell the services but will fail to deliver",2.0

3149,very disappointed with the service not the first time but actually the second time when it comes to virgin media. been with virgin media for 18 month contract and felt that there's no recognition of a valuable customer  and after the offers have finished noticed that prices started to go up on the bills  resulting in leaving the company and went with sky. further approached by a on the door  virgin media sales representative who offered a mouthwatering deals no-one can resist  and same day we were convinced to join the virgin media. following the initial process when we realised that it doesn't have the full deal  we contacted the virgin media team  who clearly stated that the deal is not factual  and tried to convince us for a much expensive deal. convinced on many occasions that the team will contact but no contact made. eventually after 4 days of the drama  we were able to terminate the contract. and guess what as expected no apologies from the team and no cooperation  even though they missold the product and we provided the evidence to prove this.,2.0

3165,"avoid! we have been paying for a 200mb service  which for the last 14 months has been operating steadily worse and worse.  it was great for 6 months but then started to deteriorate. we do get 200mb  but only during off-peak times.  during peak hours we max out around 40 if we are lucky  but regularly drops to 2 or less. at these times our upload speed drops well below the usual 10-12mb and our ping can reach as high as 900!  this means all downloading and online gaming grinds to a halt. when we download files on one pc  the latency increases to 900 and the other 2 pc's on the network are essentially unable to use the internet. in april 2016 we called and were told the problem is due to our local area being saturated since sept 2015  it should be fixed sept 2016.  when we called in oct 2016 saying the bb was still getting worse we were told the date for the fix was nov 2016. we eventually managed to register a complaint by email  their contact info says it's not possible to register a complaint by email! i would love to see what ofgem say about this...  but did manage to find a complaints email address in the end.  needless to say virgin didn't respond to the email even though we received a delivery and read receipt within 2 minutes of the email being sent.  after the obligatory 5 working days without getting a reply we then called them  and they advised our complaint has been escalated to a manager and we will receive a call in 3 working days.  that 3 working day period finished yesterday and we have not received the promised manager callback. we are outside of our contract end date so we could switch  and we have had our monthly bill reduced by the statutory â£12 for sub-standard service  but we want something done to actually fix the problem and i no longer believe the statutory minimum is sufficient after 14 months of problems. after reading 4 solid pages of complaints on here i have zero expectation we will get what we want and deserve. their call centre staff have always been polite and patient  and all based in the uk  however they are unable to fix the issue. i believe their contention ratio must be through the roof due to over-selling and i'm really unhappy with their price increases.",3.0

3191,"!!!virgin mobile charged me â£44 for only 300mb internet!  i was charged â£44 for only 300mb i've used at virgin mobile. let me explain how this happened.   i was originally calling virgin media this summer to stop its broadband contract from re-occuring automatically after the contract expiry date  while somehow was transferred to the virgin mobile team where the staff induced me into signing up the â£5 contract deal with virgin mobile.the contract was agreed over the phone call where i was not having the contract with me  the only way i could know about the terms and conditions of the package deal was through what the staff had told me. the staff only informed me what was included in the â£5 monthly deal but did not tell me that there would be a â£2 charge per day after i reached the package's internet limit as long as the mobile data is 'on' in the mobile's settings. this means even if you have not used your browsers at all  which means you have used almost 0mb data   you'll still be charged â£2 day. this is undoubtedly a very crucial commercial information which would have influenced my decision of choosing whether or not to enter into this contract  yet the staff omitted to tell this information to me.  apart from this  at that time i was having a monthly deal with another mobile company which just started  so i told the staff that i would be paying twice if i sign the contract with virgin mobile on that day. however  the staff said that she would send me a cheque which covers the expense of that other mobile company's service so that i would not be paying twice  i singed the contract yet never received the cheque.also  the staff did not tell me we'll have to pay â£5 in order to start the contract. i used to trust virgin mobile and therefore i signed the contract on that day based on all these information. i have received text messages informing me that i have used up all of the package's monthly data  but  unlike what most of the other mobile companies do  the message also never told me about the â£2 charge thing.  ******therefore  based on trade customs  i assumed that i would only pay for the data i have used.    never expected that for the past two months  i have been charged â£44 in total for only 300mb extra while 300mb only worth â£3 according to virgin mobile's 'pay as you go'!!! ******i cannot believe that i was charged more than 10 times of the actual worth of the service which is definitely an unfair commercial behaviour  yet when i called virgin media  they simply said as i signed up the contract there is nothing i can do about it.  i'm very disappointed and scared by this service therefore i stopped the monthly package and now i don't want to have anything to do with virgin media as i feel very insecure about their potential 'landmines' hidden behind their tricky business veil.  i hereby sincerely warn all virgin mobile customers to be very careful about their service  and to get to know about all the key details of the service by ourselves instead of simply relying on what the staff tell us during the negotiation service.  ******we defo should protect our rights and fairness we are entitled to as customers!!",2.0

3235,"we have been with virgin media for nearly 16 years  and the service was always good. tv and broadband offerings are great  but the customer service and quality of the technical support is now terrible.  if anyone is thinking of switching to virgin i would strongly suggest you don't. broadband service in the last year has been terrible  with lots of downtime  at one point for two weeks straight!  these were area problems i might add so nothing to do with our equipment. the technical support is terrible with these type of issues as they just play you the same recorded message with no eta to fix. but the final nail in the coffin was when we moved house  we set our move date a month in advance  and we were told the de-connect re-connect was all set. i was dubious as the guy on the phone didn't seem to know what he was doing  and no surprise  we re-connected at the new house and nothing worked. we called on day 1  day 2 and by day 3 they said there was nothing they could do and needed to send an engineer out in 2 weeks time! nothing sooner!!!!! day 4 everything started working  broadband up and tv working fine  so we left it a day and then called on day 5 to cancel the engineer. day 6 woke up  and broadband service down. we called them again  2 hour wait for 1st line support  and they didn't have a clue what i was talking about. explained i need the engineer visit as it has stopped working again  and they said that was unavailable now and would be a further 2 weeks at least. they told us our internet and tv was up and working and we were wrong that it wasn't!!! day 7 our new neighbours knocked on the door and asked if we had virgin media because something funny had happened to theirs. it turns out their service had been cut off and they had been given our services  even their phone number had changed! i called virgin media to explain their mistake in activating at the wrong address and they told me this was impossible and basically that i was stupid and or lying.... at this point i told them to just cancel my contract of 16 years because i was so wound up  and to my surprise the guys response was ""okay thats done for you now  good luck with your new provider""... no apology  nothing!! i'm sure there are no guesses what happened next  our neighbours phone line cut off as well as all of our services. lets say they are not happy at all either  and currently waiting for an engineer to come and reconnect them! what a way to start a relationship with new neighbours!  thanks virgin media  16 years of loyalty repaid with unorganised services  under qualified technical staff  and frankly rude customer service. just waiting for my sky q install next wednesday!",1.0
3236,very poor quality broadband speed although they say it's up to 100mb. we don't get half of it even we can hardly browse. when called the customer service fault team for so many time to report fault  we had to wait for more than 1 hour but received the worst customer service. the people work there are not professional  trained or helpful to resolve problem. worst possible experience with virgin media. they are charging more than â£50 each month claiming that they offer 100mb but in fact the speed is often not more than 10mb. no network signal upstairs and their router is poor quality too.,4.0

3241,have been with virgin media with 8 months now and the broadband has stopped working 3 times now  and every time we call they say someone will come after 1 week to look at it which is pointless. i have the 50mbp fibre optic broadband but at the moment it is nothing highest it goes to is 10. i am fed up with the broadband turning off and working slow this is really bad and annoying and virgin media are not really helping to understand or do something quicker for us.,2.0
3242,absolutely awful! should never have left sky which was 100 times better. catch up and recording options are rubbish and is impossible to watch something from last week. it is also far too complicated and often stops working and won't let you watch anything on demand catch up. don't bother with virgin,2.0

3245,i've been with loads of mobile providers over 18 years and this is definately the worst. internet and texting works intermittently so most of the time doesn't send messages or log on to internet. customer services say it's temporary  then say it's my phone when i've tried  various phones. now they've decided it must be the sim card so i'm waiting for a new one-which they said would arrive today but hasn't. never paid for such a faulty service- it might be cheap but that's because you're paying for nothing!,2.0

3250,it's got to be the worst i've had. not because of a slow broadband or problem with the service. the problem i have is how quick they are to suspend services and there is no in between with them. no warning or anything. also adding a further â£3. 45 charge this year. what on earth for?? like they don't claw in enough already. they're greedy and as soon as i can i'm getting shot of them. just covered one bill & anther one dropped seems like a never ending bill. wish i'd never touched them and stayed with my previous supplier.,3.0
3251,"i waited 5 years to get back to virgin  having had many long years of satisfactory service. i moved into a virgin area 6 months ago and signed up to 200mb broadband and the whole deal. like many others reporting here  i have had constant issues with the speed  connection lag and the overall tv package. the tivo box often hangs or records stuff i have not asked it to record  whilst not recording the shows i ask it to record. the on demand has regularly gone down particularly in the first two months of service. it uses a thumbs up or down system to learn what you may like to watch  however my box gives a thumbs down to ones i like and although it was funny at first i spend ages deleting programmes i did not want. the house phone is a white elephant. i did not want it in the first place  no one i know calls me on it  however it is a perfect medium for all the ppi and accident chasing cold callers. i have regularly made my thoughts known to virgin who on two occasions offered to compensate me  then increased the bills! they clearly know the service is not up to standard  because when i ring in the first thing i hear is someone telling me ""we can see that there are service issues in your area   blah blah"". this is month 6 and i had enough. they promptly charged me â£230 to cancel the remainder of the contract. i tried to tell the company  that i have not received a satisfactory service or any compensation for that  so i felt it was a cheeky asking me to pay that much for cancellation. on a few occasions i could not understand some of the customer service advisors as their spoken english was not good enough to be a call handler.  i used to think that virgin was the best of the providers  unfortunately this last few months has put me off ever using them again.  top tip richard  it is the customers that give you the means to fly your balloons high in the sky  the virgin brand is being ruined by this level of service. i also cancelled my virgin gym membership.",2.0

3273,been with virgin since they took over blueyonder 10 years back. up until 18 months ago i couldn't really fault them.  always been quick to fix and resolve issues   along with numerous speed bumps over the years.  however their aggressive expansion of customer numbers has led to a severe dip in quality due to contention over subscription.  since early 2015 we've experienced issues from 4pm till long after midnight every day.  i'm on a 50mb connection which during this time will max out at maybe 5mb. in effect under 10% the advertised speed.  finally complained after 12 months of waiting for some fix to be told in march there was a known fault.  now this fault was pushed back month after month and now i'm told is due to overcapacity. they also advised the speed upgrades are being cancelled for my area due to this issue.  my problem here is that they have an issue which they are not sharing with their customer base.  it took many phone calls and staff to get to the root of the problem and they will only refund you â£7.50 per month  if you call.  so i have to waste time calling once every fix date has passed to go through the whole dance again and again   repeating the exact same conversation.  i was hoping the speed dip was related to the work on providing the speed upgrades  given thats what i've been led to believe my price increases are for .  sadly however it's not the case.  basically if you are a new customer i'd steer clear until they get to grips with the over selling as their network is falling apart.   if i could i'd go to bt   but sadly they max out at 38mb.,1.0

""you will definitely see our van outside your house connecting the cable boxes within 3 days"". he also told me that he'd reduce my contract down to a 12month one. i decided to keep it in place  as all other providers would also take 2 weeks. i then did some shopping around and went back on the virgin website to compare. they'd just reduced their contracts to 12months and cost down to the same iâd been offered. so basically they'd just offered me the new rate. i called the cancellation team back. a gentleman then said the rate i was going to get was actually â£11 off my original rate. so iâd be paying â£30 a month for 12 months  which was pretty good. also he promised to send through my new contract showing all this asap.  3 days went by and there was no van  construction or contract.  i signed up with bt who would install 2 days after if the 4th attempt didn't happen. 3 days before the install i could see no visible signs of ""light construction"" on any of my street or near the cable boxes. i cancelled and will never be using them. at the end of the day if someone had said ""the permit to start works outside your house might take 2months. when it's approved we'll contact you to arrange a date for install"" i'd of happily waited. instead they just lied to me.",1.0

3342,truly horrendous. avoid at all costs. we were with virgin for several years and faced repeated poor broadband speeds with poor technical support. we moved house. virgin agreed to transfer the broadband with us to the new address on the day of our move. the night before we were due to move virgin called and said they continue instal broadband at our new address - it would take 8 weeks to get it set up. in essence virgin shamefully and bare fadedly lied. customer service is hideous. it's impossible to speak with anyone. you just keep going round in circles according to various automated voice menus. i cannot strongly enough say how poor the service has been.,1.0
3343,signed up in december  paid line rental saver  this wasn't allocated correctly into the account so paid it again in july  they charged an additional â£20 as the cost had gone up and without telling me said that the new line rental saver was only available for use from july for 12 months  effectively making me pay for 7 months extra that won't be used as my contract ends in 12 months. despite making attempts to pay the balance over the phone and there being confusion on the account caused by virgin media errors and over an hour on the phone later *amy* hung up the phone to start the process over again. landline wasn't installed correctly so left without service for 6 months no offer of compensation. possibly one of the worst customer service experiences i've had.,2.0
3344,very poor service  in the last 2 weeks we have had 3 days of no internet and no virgin tv. i phoned them 2 weeks ago and they agreed to refund 2 days service. when i eventually got hold of them again today they said it was maintenance.  they also said that they always write and inform their customers if they are doing maintenance  i have never received anything from them informing me. i asked why i was paying for a service that i am not receiving  they have said they will now refund 3 days usage  but as yet have not refunded any. they also said that a 'manager' would call me within 2 hours today  but this did not happen.,2.0

3350,utter shambes. virgin updated their systems knowing that this would cause  loss of service to a generation of loyal customers who have been with them since the days of ntl. there was no prior warning. as soon as i phoned they explained that i needed a new hub but it is now 10 days later and they continue to fail to send us one. on friday i called to explain that their system was yet to allocate a tracking number for our hub  only to be fobbed off by being told it would be sent over the weekend. needless to say it is now monday and no tracking number has been allocated  despite a promise to deliver by today.in short  this is contemptable customer service.,2.0

3459,"tried to install virgin superfast broadband in my new home after being pleased with the fast speed in my old home and putting the lengthy delays for installation down to one-off problems that would not be repeated.  total nightmare! booked installation on three separate occasions.  on each day  you are asked to take a half day off work but nobody turns up and the format of my day was identical: 1. lots of promises from a helpful sounding phone team all day long  that the technician was on his way to my home  held up but would definitely come albeit late.  every time that you phone them  you are made to wait for 10 - 40 minutes  whilst paying for the call if your virgin phone line is not yet installed . 2.  around 7pm to 8pm each day  the technicians switch off their phones and go home.  the helpdesk people then admit that they cannot get through to the installation men any longer and ask you to call back in the morning to rebook another installation day.   3. call back next day  another long wait to be answered   only to be promised the ""first available new installation date"" a couple of weeks away. 4. this cycle repeats itself endlessly with no actual installation. other issues are: a  your contract arrives with a higher price than you agreed to.  this also occurred on every occasion that i renewed at my old address.  you phone up  only to find that your old price has mysteriously disappeared from their system and settle for a new price.  a contract for this lower price is promised but never arrives.  result: the only paperwork that you possess is for a much higher price than you ever agreed to. b  issue  a  above is irrelevant really because one or two months into your 12-18 month fixed price contract  virgin will increase your prices anyway.  expect two or three price rises during your 12-18 month ""fixed price"" contract as this is what i regularly had at my old address.  each time  you have the right to threaten to leave  without penalty  and renegotiate a new contract  but of course this involves the long wait for the helpdesk and hassle that you could do without.  c  if you find yourself still having no installation after three booked appointments  you switch to another broadband provider and then have to argue with virgin to get your money back  with more promises of new dates for installation. yes  the service is fast and cheap if you ever actually finally get it installed and are willing to fight over the price every 3-4 months  but if you actually want a reliable installation with a company that you can trust  then virgin media is not for you.",2.0

3487,where to begin. i signed up to get virgin media vivid 100 on the 29th february  three and a half weeks ago  after one of the webchat team said my house was able to get it. the installation day was 11th march  i was asked to be here from 9am  so i took a day off work unpaid. the installation team turned up and said they needed to send their manager round to take a look and they went away. a few hours later a van pulled up outside and the supposed manager got out  expecting him to ring the doorbell or call me  i didn't go out  and next thing i knew the van had gone again and bright green spray paint had been sprayed all down the road with a big arrow pointing at my house. no one contacted me to let me know what was going on  despite a manager coming round. i was in all day and had to call customer service three times and speak to various people before i found out that a note had been left on the account that construction work would need to be done before the installation could take place. i said there and then that i wanted to cancel it but was passed on to a cancellations guy who practically begged me to stay with virgin media  reducing the monthly cost  who assured me everything would be done and installed two weeks later. so today  the 24th was booked as installation day  i took another day off work  unpaid  so that i could be here  as requested  to meet the installers. so three and a half weeks have gone by since i was told i could get virgin media internet  in those three and a half weeks  1 installation team and 1 manager have visited the property. 13 days have gone by since i was told construction would be complete and i would have internet set up by the end of today. i had a text from virgin at 9am this morning  confirming that an installer was going to visit. the end of the day comes  no one has contacted me or visited  so i call customer service and after speaking again to three different people from three different departments  i find out that a team visited yesterday and decided the construction work couldn't be done. no one bothered to call me  text me or email me to let me know that! i was told some team did try to contact me today but couldn't get through which is completely unbelievable seeing i have been making and receiving calls fine all day  but instead i got a text this morning confirming it was going ahead as planned and was led to believe that all day as no one reattempted to contact me  by email  text or phonecall. i received no contact all day from virgin media to let me know that or to apologise for the complete goose chase i have been led on  the dire lack of communication in general  and the huge inconvenience of having to take two unpaid days off work. i've lost â£140 from my paycheck and waited nearly a month for absolutely nothing. i am then recommended by the website to make a complaint over the phone  and am told after speaking again to multiple people  that i can't make a complaint or receive any compensation because my account has been cancelled! is this a joke!,3.0

3531,i was a virgin media customer for over 10 years  and to begin with everything was great.  around 4 years ago at our previous address we began to have problems with the broadband connection  it became intermittent and extremely slow  around 1mb s instead of 100mb s .  after contacting their customer support team they advised me that this was due to an overiutilisation problem in the area and that it was scheduled for work to be completed within 6months  so i bit the bullet  they reimbursed me the cost of the broadband from my bill and then i just waited  and waited and waited... finally after 12months of waiting i moved house  the problem still hadnt been fixed . so moving house  new area... no overutilisation problem... wrong! again  the same problem  so again.. im waiting  and waiting and waiting... i felt angry... id been sold a service at my new address that vm couldn't deliver on!  i'd been tied into a contract to which vm could not deliver  after lenghty conversations with their customer retention team they finally agreed to release me from this contract that they were unable to provide me with the services i was paying for! so i bit the bullet and switched to ee fibre broadband  i couldnt believe the diference in speed.. ive read reviews on ee and most are poor and i believe relate to the adsl connnections. let me tell you from first hand experience their packages are a good and fair price and the service they delivered has been second to none. im more than happy and as long as the service continues i would have no reason to leave. i will never use virgin media again. lie after lie with them to keep you onboard  and when they cant even provide the service youre paying for they dont want to let you out of the contract?  is this even legal? i was always under the impression that if they are unable to provide the services through their fault... which it was  then they have to release you from your contract?  they didnt want to! terrible service  terrible company! if your over utilised then stop selling the services until you can manage the numbers you already have!,1.0

3568,supposed to have installation between 1pm and 6pm today. came home to be present as they asked for someone over 18 to be here. as time went on tried to contact them. eventually got through the annoying automated service to speak to a customer service person.  what a waste of time. told me a string of excuses from the installer might have been ill to he may have gone home.  said i might still get a visit but really had no idea.  now gone 7pm so beyond the window of time they give and not even a courtesy of a call.  no idea what's happening. unfortunately i cancelled my sky broadband to get higher speed.  fortunately i didn't move the tv package at the same time and no chance of that happening. i will settle for the existing speed with sky rather than deal with this incompetent organization. will now ring sky apologies for moving and see if they can help me out.,1.0
3569,don't get the money back if u refer a friend - customer service don't care- finally left after nearly 20 years - bills wrong too always increasing,2.0
3570,i truly regret joining this company and handing over any money. i have experienced nothing but trouble and terrible and patronising customer services. when i first joined  they put up my bill after the first few months  with no explanation. i have lost broadband connection several times with no information available. the last straw was in january when i lost connection for up to five days  i work from home  so this was a big problem for me . everytime i called the date was extended for the broadband and tv to be working again. i was told i  would receive compensation...which worked out at around â£6 off my bill  after spending around â£40 having to travel into work . i was told that was all they could offer!!! i complained to the head office  and recieved no acknowledgement or apology. i then phoned in  and was told they will get back to me....the only time they got back to me was to tell me that my bill was going up again!!!. i decided to just leave the company and was told that i have to pay up to 30 days after  even if i am not using their services. this has been truly appalling service  that actually just leaves you frustrated. i highly recommend to go with another provider. they can offer you good deals at first but find ways to get more money out of their customers. they offer no good deals or even any good customer services once you are fully into the contract. i have even had friends and family say they are leaving the company asap. worst company to join.,2.0
3571,"i have been a virgin customer for a long time and am fed up reading advertisements from virgin telling me how fast my broadband is when it patently is not. the service offered by virgin in se3 is both unreliable and slow and all my conversations with virgin end at the same place - they give me all kinds of flannel as to what it could be before they finally admit that the service in this area is overloaded and advise that i should try to change my broadband channel at busy times  it's like being a cb radio ham in the 1980's  good buddies! . i presently  and allegedly  have ""up to 50mb of super fast broadband"" - or if you ask them enough questions virgin confirms that the 50mb is the maximum  they actually guarantee no minimum speed  if you are using a wifi connection .it amazes me how broadband  a service that is essentially a utility now  can be so patently mis-sold  if a gas or electricity supplier provided a service as unreliable as virgin they would go out of business.",2.0
3572,horrendous.  booked installation.  never turned up.  called them and on the phone for 30 minutes to be told they cancelled the installation without telling us.  tried to say that we emailed them to cancel it  but then admitted that was not true.  told i would be put through to manager to rearrange installation and then left on hold for 30 minutes and nobody picked up.  simply want to cancel installation and never use them if this is how they treat customers.,2.0
3573,since joining virgin media for broadband i have experienced poor service. took deal in nov 2015 to have price increase a month later!  wouldn't mind if service was reliable and within agreed speeds! look to get 5mbps most days during peak times  what ever that means . virgin not bothered at all usual rubbish about over utilisation on my area  would be interested to find out just how much of virgins network is over utilised and how they get away with advertising speeds upto 200mbps when they can not consistently provide a stable speed of near 5mbps. customer service  what customer service  they have no standards and follow no set procedures. steer clear of this train reck of a company or you will regret it.,2.0
3574,if you live in this area don't bother with virgin network issues since november and always takes over a week to fix. too many broken promises this time for repair the completion time has changed 5 times and has not worked for 10 days if it is finally fixed on the latest guess this will be 13 days. so if you are looking at email in this area buy stamps and send your mail it will at least get there and probably quicker,2.0
3575,having placed an order for 100mbswith virgin media  in november 2015  two attempts were made to install the service. but  on both occasions  the cable in the road had not been puti in! it seems virgin's internal communications are non existent! as for customer service? no one has ever called me to apologise  and i am always required to call them!,2.0
3576,very very disappointed. we had sales person visit our property on 15th january  to be installed today 29th january. booked day off work. received email 1 week ago with 7 day countdown until installation. appointment was from 8-1pm  i rang the sales agent at 11pm who informed me they would be ontime  but can run upto 20 minutes late but that is unusual. i waited until 1pm then rang  spoke to agent who informed me that it was recognised on 23rd january that due to cable issue it would be another 4-6 weeks. we had no notification whatsoever. extremely annoyed and very disappointed  due to lack of communication it was not a good start therefore cancelled the lot.,2.0
3577,i recently joined virgin media and regret doing it orded it on line said everything was good and gave me a delivery date for my box that day came an no box so i rang up and they said they have my details but said i haven't pick a package i did i wanted the 200 mbps then they said to get it i have to pay â£25.00 that was it so payed that then box came faulty had to wait a week for them to come out with a new one got online signed in to there site only to notice i only have the 50 mbps and that my bill was â£50.25 they charged me â£20.00 delivery fee for the box which was ment to be free so i rang back up and the customer service was bad when they don't know what to do they put the phone done 4 time its happened so rand back asked to speak to a manager and got it put down again i wouldn't recommend,2.0
3578,"i've never had so many problems i thought sky was unreliable but virgin are a disgrace1. the internet and tv drop out at any moment but when phoned i'm given a recorded message about updating services 2. the bill fluctuates but when i questioned it i was told by some stroppy little gimp it's because of the calls i make but keep in mind i don't make calls it's primarily for incoming apart from phoning virgin to question what they are doing.",2.0
3579,experienced three outages in december alone and that was when i was home to know. more last night and still nothing this morning. definitely switching once decide to what. they cannot be relied on and can never even explain what the issue is.,2.0
3580,when i signed it was agreed no installation fee  and it is written on the contract  i get charged 2 months and an instalation fee on first bill  no help when it was set up and get a letter after 1 month saying the fees are going up by â£3.50 per month. when i called they simply said i can leave don't worry about cancelation fee  really awful service and product having worked for virgin companies know this isn't the ethos of virgin at all but stay clear of virgin media!,2.0
3581,"ukâ£50 off your invoice for referring a friend? :   rather poor service and reps lack information to the customer's advantage? i recommended a friend to take on virgin media broadband + phone. i tried to get information on the site  but had certain problems with my various requirements for the friend. to my surprise a virgin rep turned up when i was at their house and signed up the contract. actually when i told him i recommended the person  he never mentioned about the ukâ£50 credit to my virgin media account. tried nearly two days to get any sensible reply to my many telephone request about the scheme and could not find a department that could help me with the inquiry  not to mention the repeatedly times i had to go through all the data clearance when i got transferred. eventually getting through to a person who told me straight forward. tough luck  unless you order via the web  on line only  no way of getting the ukâ£50.00p credit to your account. thanks virgin....... considering i have been using virgin  mobile  since 1997 and then the broadband when ntl was taken over. not a happy customer anymore.",2.0
3582,we're on a service that's advertised as 160mbit  and we reliably get ~150. solid  no arguments from me. we've been with virgin for about 10 years now  reliability has been decent  average of less than one significant  >1hr  incident per year  plus the odd few minor hiccups. not had any customer service issues with changing services   moving home  tech support has been a bit iffy but got there in the end.,3.0
3583,virgin sent us a letter saying that the cost would go up. when we phoned to say we were leaving them they said that they only wanted us to phone them so the price could go down. someone is not being honest. this may well be a criminal offence under section 2 of the fraud act 2006  although i have no confidence in the authorities doing their job. have moved to plusnet and the signal strength is better  despite it coming down the phone wires.,3.0
3584,i have waited 9 weeks for service connection and keep being promised one thing then another  but no promise is ever fulfilled. waited 6 weeks for virgin to pull a cable from the ground in order to connect my service but even though they have had 6 weeks to do this  the technician who finally looked at the cable today reported that the cable needed pulling.. i was told this 6 weeks ago but clearly this communications company need longer to communicate a simple message to themselves. i'm now left hanging again  without phone  tv or broadband. how much longer will they take to sort out such a simple issue?,1.0
3585,we changed to virgin tv & broadband bundle 6 weeks ago. the internet has been very slow from the start  we have been complaining for weeks before they sent an engineer who was unable to resolve the problem. he promised that his supervisor would visit the next day but no one turned up. i called their customer service and was promised a call back from a supervisor within an hour  no one called  ever. a series of empty promises and incompetence throughout the virgin media business. with the recent virgin price increase  everyone can choose to leave which is highly recommended - switch to a better supplier!,2.0
3586,as a new customer i am very unhappy with my experience of virgin media  the offer given over the telephone by a virgin representative was totally fictitious - i was offered a six month contract  but when paperwork came through the contract was for 18 months!  the monthly fee was also higher than that promised.  when i tried to cancel i was told that the contract had been activated  although i had not phoned to confirm  as instructed  or signed any paperwork.  i have now been told that i'll have to wait 7 more days to cancel which brings me right up to the legal dead-line for cancelling - very suspicious!,2.0
3587,"virgin media pricing behaviour is unethical. customer services are obviously trained to provide misleading information to customers. to obtain fair deals  you have to constantly haggle them  which is tiresome. the quality of the broadband varies. we had very slow for months. this is why we obtained full details of our billings.",1.0
3588,i don't know how other suppliers in uk are  but i've lived in 2 different locations that had virgin media broadband and my god they are bad. i've never experienced packet losses like these in my entire life. a simple game played online has 300 ms lag. it's like playing with china not with europe. worst internet i've ever had and if i didn't have to stay half a year more on it i'd moved to any other provider. terrible  disgusting level of performance  if you can even call it that.,2.0
3589,virgin media service in the worst i have ever dealt with for 4 months i have had limited channels due to a corroding wire apparently but now its a another problem which they need council permission to fix?? but still take full â£100 a month out my account no problem  work men have came to my house and asked me why they are three which is a joke and have slated there own employer about how terrible the company is  i cannot say strongly enough if your thinking of joining virgin dont you will regret it,1.0
3590,i have just had my free upgrade to superfibre 70 and it is terrible  it was bad enough before but it now drops out after about 5 minutes requiring a repair with the router  sometimes i have to restart the router too  the customer support is so bad that when i finally managed to speak to someone i had been on hold so long that my hand set battery died and needed recharging  if you had a zero star rating i would have used it as 1 star is too good for this service.,2.0
3591,i have been experiencing intermitent problems with access to my e mails  internet  phone and tv. this is very frustrating especially as virgin have increased the price late 2015 and there is another increase february. why should i have to pay more for problems!!!!,2.0
3592,i am without broadband for 4 days now. i contacted them 4 days ago and i was told to reset my router then i was told there were issues in my area. one day later  received a text message saying all back again. i rebooted the router many times since and their system says all working for me. now they need to send an engineer but it will be in 7 days time. what a great service from this company whose customer service people do not understand anything technical or do not understand how the world has evolved. i am with them for more than 10 years and now it is getting worse and worse so definitely i moving away from this company when my contract expires.,2.0
3593,"this is an update to a review i gave last week as i have needless to say had no resolution but thought it useful for potential london se users to be aware of what they might sign up for. so i finally got a response today 14th jan after telling them i would cancel. to be fair the supervisor who i won't name was helpful to the extent she could be.  on 12th jan i was down to 3mb for a supposed superfast service after an engineer came around earlier in the same day and said there was no problem during the day but he couldn't vouch for the evening . i asked for my complaint to be sent to me. that was refused. my complaint was escalated to networks who admitted my service was v slow  now 7mb instead of 150mb  but inside their level escalation level where they re-cable. so i asked the network engineer was he saying he would do nothing even though he could see my speeds were 7mb for a purported 150mb service and he apologised but said there was nothing he could do. so we are going to cancel the lot and we have wasted time and money and as others have said some of the support people are a disgrace although some do try. london se13  avoid virgin at all costs. they have been totally disingenuous and save the last contacts totally unhelpful and lacking in basic knowledge. for those of you who can be bothered here is the complaints address: virgin mediacomplaints dept.matrix courtllansamletswansea sa7 9bb",2.0
3594,the broadband service itself is fair to good but the customer service is shocking and when a sales advisor tells you a price is fixed it is a bare faced lie. they can raise your bill by whatever price they seem fit at any point they like because it says they can in the ts and cs therfore once your stuck in a contract you have no choice but to pay  as it was for me  a near â£10 increase over 6 months,2.0

3742,"i have to say i joined virgin media a few years back and then all was good  broadband was fine and more than usable even in peek times. it was tweaked to 30 mbps and still all good and more than adequate for apple tv and any other computing items and coping well with hd downloads. early this year virgin again tweaked the broadband to 50 mbps needles to say to compete with the now upcoming bt and sky 38 mb services and i thought brilliant another tweak in speed and with greater use of internet tv services and interest in 4k tv through netflix i was over the moon  sadly it wasn't to be as i started to notice that my broadband wasn't anywhere near doing what it should. i ran tests and found that i was pulling between 0.25-3.5 mbps and this was consistent daily. i reset the router and even changed the frequency as advised buy virgin and no joy. i left it for a while and thought perhaps it's one of those things but the speed just seemed to get worse so i contacted virgin media direct... at first they told me there were no issue in the area but after pressing matters they admitted the road needed digging up and they were awaiting permission from the council to do the upgrade then they gave me a â£7 reduction which i had to contact them every month to apply to the account and for there problem which they kept under wraps. even more frustrating were there price hikes.. you get a discount for the issue then within weeks you get an e mail saying something was going up. i have since tried to contact them only to be cut off after waiting on numerous occasions and other issue i had were when my wife left i wad in personal hell and because i was a week late on payment and despite me phoning them they happily slapped a late payment fee and cut me off for a whole 2 days even though i had never had payment issues ever in the past either. i have now had to go down the rout of e mail complaints and filling in online forms which generally i get a sorry and no action taken. virgin treat there customers in a poor way and as soon as i can i am leaving  if anyone reads this thinking of moving to them then i ask you to go online and check the daily comments on there site on face book and every day you see the same with people paying top dollar fir there 150 mbps service and pulling about 1% of that. i have previously been with sky and although i have had my moans they did seem vastly more pro active in helping and even through the credit crunch after i contacted them to suspend services they managed to sort something out with the monies i had already paid and i paid next to nothing for 6 months but they had never ever suspended services if i had called in. so my advice is "" don't ever sign up with virgin  they suck you in then once you sign will treat you poorley and take you for everything'",2.0

3757,"i felt that i wanted to have something in writing as i'm really disheartened by the customer service i have received in recent weeks and i have been advised over the phone that you do not accept complaints in writing.on 25th july i called to enquire about changing my big kahuna package as i was unhappy with the second price rise in 6 months and felt that it was becoming expensive. both myself and my husband  who works in it  spoke with the representative and she was advising us of technical information which was incorrect. i felt she was bamboozling me with figures and was argumentative with my husband when he queried the technical information although he knows he is correct as that is his job. after the call we decided that we wanted to leave virgin media as we were unhappy with the price rises and the attitude of the member of staff.later that day i called back to request a cancellation of my contract and i asked for the final date which was confirmed as 13th august. from this i believed the contract would end on 12th september and waited for packaging to be sent to collect the boxes. i was not informed until today that the person i spoke to is not authorised to process disconnections and the only notes put on the system were to say i have requested information about cancelling. i know this to be incorrect as i requested the information during the first call  therefore it is illogical that i would request the same information twice in one day. i am extremely angry that i was not told during that call that i was speaking to the wrong person as i had gone through the automated system to the cancellations department.at this point as far as i was concerned everything was going ahead with the cancellation. we arranged to have replacement services through sky which were all installed in mid august. therefore  all virgin media services have been unused since mid august. i accepted that there would be some crossover of services and i would need to pay for both contracts for approximately 1 month.i was therefore very surprised to receive a full bill last wednesday  covering up to 7th october. on thursday i called to query the bill and was put through to customer relations. i explained the situation and was advised that the notes did not state that i had requested a cancellation which is why the bill had been produced. after a lengthy conversation explaining everything your representative said she could see that the services had been unused since mid august and agreed with me that it was illogical that i would make two calls in the same afternoon requesting the same information. at my request  after discussions with her manager  it was agreed that someone would listen to the recording of the call to verify my story and someone would call me back no later than friday. i was happy with this situation as i knew i had requested the cancellation and the representative said that if my version of events was confirmed then the cancellation would be back dated to 25th july so the final date would be 24th august. if my version was proved incorrect the notice would be given from 3rd september.as i had not received a call up to today i decided to chase this up and call in again. i was told today that the notes do not state i requested a cancellation  which i already knew  and therefore it had not been processed. i explained i was enquiring about the recording as discussed on thursday to be told that the call will not be listened to as calls are not recorded for dispute resolution. i was also told that the second person i spoke to on 25th july is not authorised to cancel contracts  as far as i am concerned that should have been explained at the time not 6 weeks later. i explained that i was very upset and frustrated about the lack of consistency with what i have been told. the representative said there was nothing they could do except backdate the cancellation request to thursday meaning i have to pay for services up to 2nd october even though i was expecting the contract to end on 12th september  meaning i have to pay for an extra 3 weeks.perhaps i was naive in not recording the calls myself but as a loyal customer of nearly 6 years i feel very let down. i have been made to feel that i am lying  because i can't prove the outcome of the calls made on 25th july i am to suffer financially. i made the second call on 25th july in good faith and i feel it is not in any way my fault that the person didn't inform me that they could not help me with the cancellation and either put me through to someone who could help or advise me to call back. the person i spoke to on thursday i felt genuinely wanted to help and i was informed today she will get in trouble for trying to help by offering to have the call listened to  which was supported by her manager . i also find it baffling that you will not accept complaints in writing. i feel this has been a catelogue of poor and inconsistent customer service  with no regard for the fact the customer may be right. simply because the notes state i did not request a cancellation there will be no investigation to check that i'm telling the truth. as i informed your representative today i will be writing to ofcom and i will never consider being a virgin media customer in the future. as someone who has spent in excess of â£800 a year on services for the past 5+ years would it have been so terrible to take me at my word and refund me the â£62.50 to backdate the cancellation?",2.0

3786,i would not recommend that anyone go with virgin media or stay with them. run a mile if you can. they do not care about their customers and their service is much less than terrible. today i sat in my auntie's house who os over 80 years old. i went on behalf of her because virgin media were due to install a brand new up to date router because she was still being charged on the old blue yonder broadband provider which was not providing her with an acceptable service. we were told that they would come between 1 and 6pm. by 6.00 they hadn't arrived and we did not receive a phone call to explain where the engineer was or what was going on. i was told by virgin media at 5.50 that the engineer had stated in his system that 'he was on his way'. i asked her where he was coming from and how long he would be.she couldn't say because she didn't know. at 6.30 i rang again!. this time i asked to speak with a manager.the woman told me to explain the complaint and then she would put a mangaer on. after i told her that the engineer hadnt turned up  she tried to fob me off with....'oh we usually tell our customers that sometimes they may run a little late'. the time was now 6.30pm and at 5.50pm i was told that he was on his way. at 7.00pm  the engineer still hadn't arrived. i rang for the third time and asked to speak with a manager. someone called johnathan claiming to be a manager told me that he couldnt locate him  can you believe that!  a worker couldnt be located. ive nver heard of such nonsense before. they couldnt contact him but'he was held up in a job!'that is not what i was told before. now this johnathan was telling me that he was down to still come. dearest customers  i had made plans  my auntie had made plans for after 6.00 bu we couldn't keep to our plans because virgin media has mucked up our day. i have never ever experienced from any provider such an awful uncaring and unprofessional behaviour. my auntie cancelled virgin media and is now with sky broadband. i am also with sky broadband and they are amazing!!!so  speaking from experience.....leave virgin media and their crap service alone.,3.0

3843,"iâve been with virgin media for almost five years now with an average spend of around â£50 per month in that time. that works out to around â£3000 that iâve spent on a service that has continually let me down. so you might be asking why am i still with them? well initially  my company was paying for the virgin media service so when they first started letting me down with crackling on the phone line  i wasnât really that bothered. it meant i didnât have to speak to my colleagues as often! it took them about a year to solve the issue and everything was ok until recently again. at the start of the year 2015  i noticed the router would occasionally disconnect from the network and struggle to reconnect. having called out the engineers several times and given one excuse after another  i am still having the issue 6 months on. itâs been getting worse over the past month. i called them today when my router was down  and during my conversation with a very hostile customer service lady  it came back on and she said there was nothing she could do now because everything was up and running again. i explained that this was an intermittent problem  but she really couldnât care less. now iâm having to decide to sacrifice speed for reliability by signing up to another provider. the last engineer that came out was a nice man who explained that there was an issue with the line running from my property to the main box in the street. he said the cable would need changing so he booked this in for me. funnily enough  which i suspect is down to the cost  he called me a day later to say that a network engineer had resolved the issue and the line would not need changing so he cancelled the job. my suspicions are that he got a rollicking from his superiors by even mentioning that option to me. it appears virgin media do not care about long standing customers. and why would they. iâve given them so much cash  they couldnât care less. the intermittent problem aside  when my up to 100mb line was working fine  it would often slow down considerably at peek times  so i could be watching netflix in hd for it only to slow down and buffer. yes they offer a very fast connection speed relative to the other providers but their customer service and dedication to resolving customer issues is really poor. i'm now looking to sign up with bt infinity.",2.0

3884,"like many i have been with vm for over 12 years and until recently i've  had little cause to complain. the prices aren't especially cheap  being an existing customer and signing up for the fastest broadband. even from day one of the upgrade there were problems and that should have alerted me that vm is not as reliable as they once were.  to their credit they did compensate me for the issues i had  but had i know that these issues were to continue i would have signed up with another provider. the broadband is fast when you can get it  but often you don't get that speed. worst still the network seems to be down quite often recently. in the last week it has been down twice in my area  including today from 1pm -9pm in the evening anticipated.customer service was useless  essentially saying 'tough' in not so many words. they claim because it's 8hrs turn around to fix the problem it is acceptable  despite the fact it's been going on several times in a short time. also  i would advise people  to call in to let them know when the broadband is down  as it is only logged on  record when you call them. otherwise they can't see that you have had a unreliable service. i was left quite angry by  response i got  to the point where i'm thinking of paying the penalty just to terminate the contract. they are like the tesco of broadband and they will learn the same way when people 'shop'elsewhere'. oh and the only reason i'm able to post this review today is by using my phone as a 'hotspot' to access the internet. avoid",2.0

3981,been with virgin media for 4 years. i pay a lot for just phone and broadband. at the start of my time with virgin they said i can't have tv and they don't do fibre optic but should do in the future. it's been now and they still said the same thing. i looked at other providers for better deals and i wanted tv in the new package. i was going to move with talktalk because it's cheaper and then 2 days later... virgin moved me to talktalk randomly. no deals or anything because i was technically a virgin customer still. i started experiencing this stupid home safe on every website i tried to get on. customer service for virgin is ridiculous  1  i kept telling them it's not my router as i can access the internet but they kept sayings it's the router  well duh i don't work there but it's not rocket science. 2  no-one speaks fluent english  i'm asian so don't say i'm racist. 3  they said i need to speak with talktalk  adds another â£20 to my bill  thanks for that. 4  promises saying they'll note it down  but we all know what happens  it goes in the bin or doesn't get noted at all. i had enough so i moved to talktalk. i actually got a fluent english speaker and his name was ben! very helpful and i'm waiting for them to move me over. they can offer me tv also! for the same price as i am paying... actually cheaper. get off virgin  it's a scam provider and hopefully watchdogs will get them because they are ridiculous. one more note when i started they said they would send an engineer to do my phone line and they didn't. first 2 months i was paying for phone line rentals when my phone wasn't installed or connected and they said i've been calling off it? lol  finally got an engineer round. can't issue refunds? lmao i left it as it is because too much hassle.,3.0

4034,"i am not a customer. but i am trying .... it seems that i need to do more. i filled in the online purchase  i agreed to pay up front  i agreed the install date and all the t&c's and sat back waiting for delivery. what a fool! i should have known that the install and delivery dates quoted on virgin's own website are fictitious  utterly fabricated lies. so sad that i'd already arranged to fly back from abroad to meet this fictitious date. an utterly wasted expense that virgin doesn't care about. all because i had to pass a credit check  this was news to me. remember i'd agreed to pay the whole contract up front ... i don't want or need any credit. and i don't have a mortgage or borrowing to 'score' me on. but that didn't matter  the virgin stupidity continued to an obvious conclusion - i didn't need credit but if i did i was good for it and therefore passed the credit check after a few days.  but those few days were enough to ensure that my trip back to uk to meet an engineer  any engineer  were wasted. they couldn't send an engineer until i am out of the country again - how unhelpful. so i wondered  i asked  because they did not  ""do i actually need an engineer ? can i just get a router and plug it in?"" yes came the reply that's what the engineer would do. i pointed out the obvious that as i am a sentient being not a cabbage i am also able to plug in a router - could they just send one to me. why yes? of course. we'll send one thursday.  well i couldn't be there thursday  but my wife could and happily she is a sentient being too. it was arranged  thursday  not before  delivered to my wife at her central london 8 storey building. oh but guess what  you'll never guess ... it didn't turn up. the courier reported at 12.30pm that he couldn't get a reply? interesting this is a building with 3 permanent receptionists - all briefed to accept this particular delivery. i suggest he did not go to the right address. so what did virgin do? nothing of course. not 'til i chased at 4.30pm did we find out that the courier could be bothered to find the correct landmark building in a central london street. virgin have no alartm or alert that deliveries had failed - pretty poor really.  i called the courier to be told the same garbage about no-one being there and then to be told of the impossibility that they  a courier  could deliver a package that day evening to the correct address which was 4 miles from their depot. i assumed they they had vehicles  maybe i am wrong. maybe yodel  the courier  relies upon elderly gentlemen carrying heavy sacks to transport their deliveries  in which case i can see that a 4 mile journey might be hard to complete in 2 hours. never the less i was told the 'driver'  of what?  had gone home at 4.30pm and the delivery might happen the next day. now you might think i was dismayed or even angry at this point. you'd be right. angry that i ever bother call virgin at all. but clutching at straws i called virgin yet again. after voicing my discontent i was bounced around a few operatives before being told that the delivery had failed - really  i had told them that 4 times at that point! and that it 'should' take place the next day. i pointed out that this was not acceptable and was told nothing else could be done. but that's not true  because i could readily imagine what could be done and thus i asked why a reliable and competent courier  of which there are dozens in london   one who has vehicles and competent staff  could not be dispatched to collect the package from the incompetent and aging hands of the old sack dragging deliveryman at yodel and whisked the 4 miles to my wife. all of this could be done  but not by virgin. they best that could be done was to make sure that it would be delivered tomorrow. apparently they only use yodel or the post  no other couriers ever!  now  i find that surprising  because i doubt that richard bransonï»¿ could have built his brilliant business empire if he was encumbered by a total inability to deliver anything on time. so i asked if this service is not good enough for richard branson  why should be good enough for me ... a customer ? but then i remembered - i am not a customer. i am just trying to be customer !! ps: 24 hours later the old man dragging a sack has finally arrived  but at the wrong address! my wife isn't where she was yesterday. i'd alerted them and updated the address to virgin and yodel  but the old sack man must have been in transit already and arrived a day late at the wrong place. so that makes it a 100% success rate for virgin - everything they have told me they'll do is wrong. i wonder if their service even works - god knows. and we can't find out until our carrier has transported the router to the right address  at our expense of course!",2.0

4085,i've got to say virgin  you guys are absolute con artists with deceiving selling tactics and who clearly want to squeeze every penny out of every service you provide. my parents had been loyal sky customers for years  9 in fact  and mistakenly thought that loyalty paid dividends. which most savvy consumers know  when you arenât getting what you paid for  you go to an alternative provider who can offer you better for either the same price or preferably cheaper. when sky broadband wasnât providing the service they were paying  i looked into a better alternative for them. virgin  as it happened  at been inundating them via the post for some time to try and sway their hand  my step father who was dubious to change as they enjoyed all the comforts of sky tv and the calls to australia  where myself and fiancã©e live  which sky offered at a good rate  wanted to see whether virgin could offer them something. my parents had the full package with sky - tv broadband phone etc and although it was the broadband they were mainly unhappy with  listened to what virgin had to offer. for a few weeks  telephone calls went back and forth with virgin  the sales advisor very keen to get my parents on aboard and eventually agreed to match what my parents were paying at sky and promised that everything my parents had with sky  they would get with virgin  apart from sky atlantic but that was fine  as they were changing for fibre-optic  they thought this was a good deal to change over from sky so decided to give it a try  bearing in mind my parents are very old school and hate chopping and changing. fast forward to this week. they had a friendly virgin chap come round and set everything all up for them in a few hours and my parents seemed fairly pleased with the easy transition. that was  however  until they decided to watch tv and noticed they werenât able to access the sky sports and movie hd channels which they of course found strange as they were promised by the virgin sales advisor that my parents would get everything that they had with sky. needless to say  my parents rang virgin to query this and would you believe the audacity of the person on the phone who said that my parents would have to pay an extra â£7 per month for the sky movies and sport hd channels !!!  of course  my step father who had to be convinced to change in the first place was both shocked and angry at this. the unsympathetic cancellations advisor or whatever they wish to call themselves  in a very patronising manner said that 'on this occasion  we will waiver the extra â£7 per month for 12 months' as if this was a gesture of good will even though my step father thoroughly explained he had been mis-sold the package. my parents eventually got what was promised and were able to get the hd channels. the next day  my parents noticed that when they were getting incoming calls the caller id was coming up as 'external caller' which they have never seen before so decided to call virgin again to find out whether this was their doing as they couldnât see the number or their phone  guess what? virgin said 'to have that facility you need to pay an extra â£2.25 per month'! now  you could be reading this thinking  its only â£7 and â£2.25 but when you put that on top of what you are already paying and when you have completely changed everything from another provider on the promise and guarantee that everything would stay the same  you feel conned and mis-sold. virgin  your selling tactics and customer service come under real scrutiny with this and because of this  you have lost what would potentially be a loyal customer  providing you gave the service which was promised  now as they are in their 14 day cooling off period  i am now helping them look for another provider. thank you for teaching us a hard lesson that dont expect to receive what you are promised  will be delivered. note to all potential virgin customers. make sure you know what you are paying for  even though they promise to 'match' whatever you were paying before. i will be posting this on other review sites and considering contacting the financial ombudsman to save anyone else going through the hassle you have given to my parents.,2.0

4173,"recently i upgraded from sky to vm  not being happy with sky's poor broadband speeds even though they claim up 20mbps. i ended up getting the vm premiere collection and so far i haven't looked back. i got this mainly because of the 100mbps broaband and i thought we might as well switch over our tv package as well just for convenience. doing a wired speed test i get on average a whopping 85mbps! and remember  even though you pay for a 100mbps  data is lost from the box on the road down the coax cable to your home  so you will never get the full speeds you want  regardless of who you are with - what matters is the percentage of data you get of what you pay for. but there is a but. we have a loft conversion and our router is located on the 1st floor of the house  meaning wifi signal is poor in the loft  it's very good on the ground floor  however. because of this poor signal i get poor download speeds  meaning i'm not getting the most out of my internet package up here. unfortunately  this isn't something an isp can solve for you because this is a problem with regards to your environment. also  wifi speeds are no where near as reliable as an ethernet connection! this is fact. but we never want to be wired up and restricted with our freedom of movement. so  the only way you can get around this is by being ingenious  spending a little money and being a bit of a geek  i'm afraid. if you can fulfill that criteria then you can do what i've done  which is buy another router  a good one that is dualband   flash it with a custom firmware  i used dd-wrt   and use it as a wireless repeater. there are tutorials on the internet that will assist you if you're not sure what to do or where to start  however  you must be computer literate and be comfortable with what you're doing! . furthermore  i bought a dualband wireless adapter to take advantage of the 5ghz band and wifi speeds. since doing this  i went from 25mbps download speeds to 70mbps download speeds - in the loft!  with sky i got a measily 5mbps and i did everything i could to make it better to no avail. with virgin i get 70% of the speeds i pay for through wifi and the package i pay for is â£5 cheaper than what i was paying for sky.  i have given 3 stars for customer service because i haven't been with them long enough to give a decisive rating on that one. broadband reliability is good  not amazing  haven't had any real issues though. i hope i have answered any questions you may have had. a lot of people don't understand networking and just jump on the bandwagon of their isp is bad and not understanding why they're having problems - remember wired > wireless.",2.0

4194,"somewhat astonished that every broadband supplier listed on this site attracts more negative comment than either balanced or positive comment! i've been with virgin media for many years.  i buy all three services  broadband  television and telephone  via cable fibre from virgin media.  virgin media inherited my account from ntlworld. overall  the broadband package serves its purpose reasonably well.  up to now  i am a relatively light user of broadband - emails  surfing  the occasional streaming of dj-less radio on sunday - but am starting to think about replacing the television with on-line equivalents. occasionally  i work from home.  in the uk morning  i can establish a vpn connection with my uk office  and the network connection is almost as fast as being physically present on the uk office network.  the uk office broadband connection is also provided by virgin media  corporate connections .  between about 1pm to 5pm uk time  although the speed of the vpn connection slows  but non-vpn traffic continues to run at a useful speed. however  over the years  between 5pm and 7pm uk time  the broadband connection sometimes fails for up to 10 minutes at a time.  sometimes  the modem remains connected  but reports no ip addresses.  at other times  the modem reports no connection at all. i have complained to virgin media about this issue before.  the usual response is to swap the cable modem and check the connection strength.  this shows some willingness to show the customer that virgin will seek to fix complaints  but swapping modems doesn't solve any server-side dns dhcp issues  neither will it overcome any traffic management policy  if any exists . virgin does not offer an instant service level agreement.  if you have a problem  virgin will do through some basic checks before arranging home visits.  home visits frequently need to be booked one week in advance  in my experience   and you'll need to trash a day of paid-leave  or a weekend  or throw a sickie  for an engineer to arrive between 8am to 6pm  then do 15 minutes of work  typically swap the modem and test it .  in all cases  engineers visiting home have left only when the service has been restored. i have more issues with the television service than the broadband service.  my main issue with the television service is that virgin  like everybody else  resells only bundles of channels.  nearly all the channels you can buy are funded by advertising.  if the advertising can fund the channel  then why i do need to pay to receive this said channel of advertising?  what exactly am i buying here?!  the advertisers should be paying me!!!  to be honest  it's an issue for the competition commission.  however  with improved broadband speeds and the reliability of cable broadband  it might be possible to stream on-demand items from the bbc and do away with the television service altogether. something to talk about in 2014!",2.0

4271,i have been with them for about 5 years now. customer service has improved a lot and if i need to call they no longer use premium rate numbers and calls are answered very promptly. the main problem is the email service which seems to very problematic lately often being down hours on end and smetimes most of the day!  i also have recently had a lot of problem acessing webmail when in the usa which i am hoping has been resolved now that its changed to googlemail. my speed is usually quite good but never get the 10mb more like 7mb on average.,2.0
4272,"to the person who says they are paying for calls try dialing 150 i havent been charged yet.i get 9 10mb  this is fast enough for my needs so im satisfied.cable is generally faster than copper but costs more  you get what you pay for",2.0
4273,well where to start ...i thougt i would get a great deal on tv phone & bb for the past 10 months i had to call 5 times about their bb so then when i rang to find how near i was to end of contract i was told if i wanted to give 6 weeks notice i would have to pay early termination or ring back in 2 weeks to give a normal months notice to get out of that clause.over the next 2 days they came back & quoted â£27 for just tv when i originally enquired about just tv being quoted â£67 then over the weekend they cut my phone off which i hadn't asked for then when rectifying this i was told it would be    2hours now the tv has stopped working. i don't think i will be ressuming as a tv only customer now !,2.0
4274,overall pretty pleased with the service although sometimes customer service is a little poor and cant understand what they mean and i'm finding that in the evenings my broadband speed drops to as low as 1 meg,2.0
4275,sporadic connection  in central manchester !! the new e-mail is a nightmare,2.0
4276,unbelievably fast broadband on desktop and laptop  getting over 40mb on both. kids love the xbox360 and always host as they always have fastest connection. good customer service as well.,2.0
4277,virgin has one major flaw  no guaranteed upload speed. this means they cannot guarantee you can send emails  upload videos to youtube  put pics on facebook or anything else for that matter of fact. i get 0.08 meg upload speed  meaning it could take 3 hours to send a 1meg email. not good enough.,2.0
4278,started off fine  around three years ago  but has since deteriorated to a service with constant outages and  at times  snail pace connection speeds  0.5 meg on todays test . with a call centre in bombay  it all adds up to one very unsatisfied customer - if it hadn't have been for the cable tv package  which is good   would have changed months ago.,2.0
4279,"installed 2 weeks ago  a fault on connection meant our internet couldn't be processed for a day after installation. this was followed by a 2 day fault in my area preventing all internet from working. we then got internet for 3 days before it failed again  a technician couldn't get out to us for 5 days and then on the date he was supposed to arrive he didn't show. quite simply the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced  offshore helpdesks that don't understand english coupled with onshore staff who lie just to get you off the phone. i have put two written complaints through as well verbal complaints without response. over a 2 week period i have had to make 22 calls to their helpdesk  i've made a record of every call and this has been included on a complaint. i cancelled the service tonight as it was making me go grey!my advice: dont get virgin!",2.0
4280,don't know why other customers complain about virgin costing so much to contact as they use a free phone service  i have no complaints get 48 - 49mb regularly on a hard wired connection & using wireless it drops due to it changing priorities on the wireless router as hard wired gets main use for ps3. i am very satisfied & problems   3  i've had over the last 10 years have been dealt with promptly. no real complaints other than them insisting on installing the 50mb modem for an extra â£35 when i could have done it myself.,2.0
4281,slowish speed but good overhaul backup and virgin keep asking if im happy with the service but i think i could do better...,2.0
4282,out of 10 meg i get between 7 and 12 depending upon which site i use to do the test and how heavily their websites are loaded. no complaints other than getting an engineer can take 2 -3 days,2.0
4283,i'm on 20meg service and have just tested it with three different speed tests. lowest was this website at 14meg  other two were 18 meg and 19.5meg.,2.0
4284,3 years running with virgin and my vpn rdp sessions time out due to extremely poor upload speeds. lots of calls logged and no fixes from virgin.,2.0
4285,recently lost broadband connection.  spent best prt of a day trying to sort this out with a useless number of virgin staff who were adamant the fault was at the router end which i knew it wan't.  eventually 3 hours later   lost days work it turned out to be a fault at their box causing a very high s r ratio.  this occured on the tuesday morning and no engineer available until friday.  i am now unable to work from home having to travel into the office costing me additional travel costs on top of the already lost days productivity and another half day at least on friday....  not an appology or anything   awful customer service....,2.0
4286,the speed is not what i expected it to be and is mostly very slow for a company who has upgraded to give the better speeds they are definatly lagging behind and don't deliver what they promise yet another case of being ripped of by these huge corporations who are only interested in getting their money from our pockets into theirs. not a very good company at all they are all sharks who promise the earth yet deliver a very poor service.,2.0
4287,the only problem is that their antivirus is not available on win 7 -  yet - when it is then this is the only supplier to be with.,2.0
4288,quite happy with almost 9meg download speed as we are in a rural location. but upload speed is poor by comparison. luckily we don't do much uploading.,2.0
4289,75 percent of the time im lucky to reach one meg when i pay for ten.they are so inconsistent with the speed i recieve.i ring up the customer service line which costs a bomb get past talking to a machine finally about to talk to a real person and it cuts out every time like it does it on purpose so you ring up and spend more money.all the swear words in the english language is what i think of this rubbish company.if bt's line installation didnt cost so much id be gone long ago from this company.,2.0
4290,bahhhh. less than 1 4 advertised speed. unacceptable.,2.0
4291,speed is 1 4 of what it should be!,2.0
4292,what customer service?,2.0
4293,virgin cable internet in the hatfield area is terrible and should be avoided at all costs  the d l speed is awful the majority of the time and the ping to london has been in excess of 8 seconds  once  and regularly exceeds 2 seconds.  they have sent engineers to rectify the problem who appear to do nothing. in short  go with another supplier  even if it has to be good ol' reliable copper wired.,2.0
4294,10meg connection. 50kbps after 5pm. rubbish. i'm thinking of cancelling.,2.0
4295,reliability poor  promised upto 20mb  but still 10mb. cust paying more for l package and get same speed as m cust. indian call centres are a joke. poor english  lack understanding  read from scripts..... why do they pretend to be called 'david' or 'simon' ... to make us believe they are in uk? complete joke.,2.0
4296,average is what i call virgin media broadband. customer service technical support not that great. whilst reporting a fault they said its been fixed just as my modem went off. they then change their mind and said its a modem fault. i know its not a modem fault  i am a network technician  most of the time the service is stable  a little slower than what i would like. speed restictions are in place between 5pm and 11pm. when calling them they have automated selection which talks way too much. i would say to anyone thinking of joining them. most of the time its a fair service 80% of the time the other 20% i would say poor but not completey bad.,2.0
4297,when speaking to a customer adviser you find you are speaking to somebody abroad they dont seem to understand english and after 20 minutes on the phone i gave up,2.0
4298,brilliant speed and value for money when its working! very unreliable.,2.0
4299,supposed to be 20meg download  have not reached that yet in 2 years  very poor ..,2.0
4300,slow broadband - i'm on 10mb  not a lot i know  but it shouldn't be this slow.,2.0
4301,not impressed by the speed,2.0
4302,it is all about sales with virgin   i have the top 50mb package at 45 pounds on it own and never have had anywher near this speed on avg over 26 weeks my speed was 11mb  virgin unhelpfull staff point out that 50mb is not what was promised at all  it is up to 50  not 50  most expensive but no where near the best  if the drinks industy sold beer in up to a pint but only supplied a pint once in a blue moon no one would buy beer  out and out dishonest,2.0
4303,the last couple of months the speed has been consistant but before that it dropped to below 1mb. oly 1 of the virgin 'techs' did any thing but the minimum to help.,2.0
4304,i am paying for 20mbps. i struggle to get above 6.6. the modem was replaced 6 months ago and again its messing around. customer service is automated system with an average of 45minutes hold listening to brain damaging music. when you get through they want your home wired network pulled apart and the modem plugged in directly.,2.0
4305,i get a max of 49.7mb out of a 50mb connection. customer service has also improved significantly since the old ntl days,2.0
4306,speed should be  upto  10 meg. speed shown after running test 0.0 meg !!! how bad is that.,2.0
4307,i pay for 20mbps but only get from 12 to 15mbps and if its peak time only 6 to 10mbps not good or happy :- ,2.0
4308,the service is appalling,2.0
4309,good product. amazingly poor customer service.... and i mean poor.,2.0
4310,the service is unreliable. every couple of months it is unavailable for extended periods i.e. greater than 6 hours. it is almost impossible to speak to anyone in customer services and normally takes at least 10 minutes before you can get through. when you finally get through all they do is book an engineer which is normally not for another 2 or 3 days by which time the problem has often disappeared. customer services are never able to tell you what the problem is or when it will be resolved.,2.0
4311,just dont seem to be getting any help and have had to take 3 days off work,2.0
4312,20mp connection. the only time i get the speed i'm paying for is early hours of the morning.,2.0
4313,enquired re slow optical speed. received a very lenghty email asking me to do various tests including entering dos. unbelievable !!! sent a email back expressing my disbelief but unsurprisingly i have not received a reply.,2.0
4314,having spend countless hours trying to resolve an issue with intermittent broadband connection for more than two months  we eventually got an engineer to confirm that my equipment was not at fault and that there was an outdoor fault somewhere. a temporary cable was installed to bypass a suspect cable under the garden. he arranged for another crew to attend in october to replace the cable for which they are hoping  misguidedly  to dig up the concrete path. they go under the path or not at all and i don't believe the fault is there or the temporary cable would have cured it!,2.0
4315,existing virgin media customer paying twice the price as the new deal for the 10mb line for a 2mb line that is constantly 'throttled back' to 1mb,2.0
4316,i pay for 10mb but get an average of 2.5mb,2.0
4317,i have wasted lots of times calling about the poor speed of my broadband and been promised several times that it would be upgraded but still not done,2.0
4318,happy enough...,2.0
4319,tried for 3 weeks to get upgrade from 2mg to 10mg its now 4mg it seems no mater who i get in touch with no one gives a damn so long as your money is still going into their bank account.,2.0
4320,the fibre optic speeds never reach 20mb which i have paid for  but averages between 10-13mb  download speeds  but about 10mb over wireless. it is expensive for the speed paid for. should be cheaper by â£5 or so per month. reliability of service is not good as bt but of a sufficient standard that you live with especially if you have to work from home sometimes.,2.0
4321,i have only had it 1 week and have already cancelled my contract. it hasnt worked properly from day 1 engineers dont bother to turn up when they say they will  they dont phone when they say they will when i complained they offered to send an engineer next week!!!!  7 days  dont even think about it!!!!,2.0
4322,i have been with virgin media now for broadband since approximately june 09  and so far my experiences have been to the highest quality. the service was fitted and within 1 hour the broadband connection was running at top speed  hitting a speed test of 9.76mbps constant for the following hours. the only problem i have ever had with the service was for approximately 10 minutes when i had a speed decrease to 3.24mbps  this was due to a hardware malfunction and nothing to do with the connection.,2.0
4323,very unhappy with the service and have trouble with the indian call centres.,2.0
4324,virgin upped the payments on broadband and said it is because we were to get faster broadband this is not so.when phoning they say it will be in the area soon. they put the price up in may. this is now august and still no faster broadband.,2.0
4325,have been paying extra for uprated broadband speed for two or three months now  but despite taking the money  i am still waiting for the up-graded service.,2.0
4326,virgin are the best  keep sky or bt i have friends who are on sky broadband they pay for 10 meg and get less than 3 that say it all for me,2.0
4327,am pleased with virgin's fibre optic broad band service  with speed usually up to 19 mbs on up to 20mbs service level,2.0
4328,just upgraded for free from possible 2mbps to 10 mbps. test showed speed as 9.45 mbps. most satisfactory!,2.0
4329,my isp is reliable and although i don't get 20mb  i get 18.1mb  but the speed is more than acceptable for the work i do on my pc.,2.0
4330,my service was 2mbps & i never got below that. it's been upgraded free to 10mbps & i think the result of this test is excellent.,2.0
4331,"after speaking to my broadband supplier the speed miraculously increased to 17meg on a 20meg paid for service - however it is useful to point out that this is ""throttled down"" during peak periods- approx 6pm to 11pm evry weekday night",2.0
4332,never reached what i'm paying for in all the time i have been a customer. stopping tomorrow,2.0
4333,very disapointed in what i am paying for i will probabally give up the internet as i find it a cash cow for ip's,2.0
4334,i cant get any programs after 6.00pm,2.0
4335,"cable broadband rocks!  ok i'm a little old to say ""rocks"" with any real conviction  but at least it works how it's supposed to  i pay for 10mb and get 9.8  which is  lets face it  close enough .",2.0
4336,never get the speed as they offer,2.0
4337,i pay for 20meg i usually get less than 10meg sometimes less than 2meg occasionally more than 19meg,2.0
4338,i am very pleased indeed with our virgin package.,2.0
4339,generally pretty good but for some reason very very slow with problems when it rains,2.0
4340,broadband speed below expected  considering monthly charge.,2.0
4341,supposed to be up to 10 mb its a question if i can get 5 mb,2.0
