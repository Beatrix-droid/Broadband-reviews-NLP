The information given was this would get fixed within a week. A week later I am told 7-Oct we will get connected as the job requires external work. A few days before that date it gets postponed to 24-Oct. I am staying home to be around that date but nothing happens. New date given was 14-Nov. Last week I called to confirm this and also asked for confirmation on VM forum chat and was told ""yes"" it will get done. Then on 14-Nov nothing happens, then sms asking to contact VM. Information ""there is external cable work scheduled for today. unfortunately we are unable to send our crew today"". Next available date 28-Nov.Sorry but I have had enough. Will switch, get my money back from VM what I have paid so far (coz the emails re ""your bill is ready"" come promptly, plus recommendations on what wonderful new movies I should be watching). Enough is enough",1.0
1,"A truly attrocious service, both in terms of broadband and customer services. My broadband has had issues from day 1 of the service and was told to increase my broadband package to improve this. I paid more for this and even then the service kept cutting out during important zoom calls.  Their customer services does not have a clue and all they seem to want you to do is reboot your router several times.   The final straw came when I was left without broadband for over a week so decided I had had enough and was going to cancel the service. When I called to cancel the services they said their computer system was down so could not cancel my service.  3 days later and I am still waiting for my services to be cancelled.  This really is appalling and would recommend anyone who is considering moving to Virgin Media to stop and rethink.",1.0
2,"They make it as hard as they can for you to cancel a contract. I was on the phone for 2 hours, had t o spend 20 minutes convinving the first agent I wanted to cancel, who then put me on hold for 1+hours waiting for a different agent. That agent hung up as soon as we connected. Two days later I'm not in a text chat that will apparently take all day. DON'T USE THEM! YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS!",2.0
3,"Pay for the 350Mbps package but only ever managed 250Mbps, upload only 34 of the 50 adverised. router is garbage, 5G wifi drops out and all other interfaces reset when it happens.  settings often disappearing  customer service not a great experience",2.0
4,"The worst customer service:-The bots ask irrelevant questions-After many questions you can be told they cant help as they are too busy-You go through security and then get transferred to whatsapp-You then have to go through security againLong waiting times between answers on whats app, up to 10-15 minutes-Questions have no bearing to the issue, its like a bot again-Loads of copy and paste: dont worry, i know how u feel, i would be too, but never get to the issue, its like a bot again-Was told the information they have access to is limited so they end up asking you questions, such as, did you receive an email, who did u speak to, etc-Silly policies dictate illogical offers-Orders will get cancelled without explanations -Support is an exercise going through the motionsThe most frustrating",2.0

6,"I wish I can give a Zero star to virgin media but unfortunately the lowest star is 1. If you intend joining a network and don't want your bills to keep increasing without being informed then please don't make the mistake of joing virgin media. They are set of liars and they lied to me in May 2019 that if I join there network I will pay Â£33 pounds for 18 month contract. After 4 month of being with virgin media, they increase there price to Â£59 pounds month, which wasn't what they initially told me. When I realised that they've increased there monthly bill, I had to end the contract, because I ended the contract they further bill me of Â£102.27, a bill that I never used and insisted that I have to pay, they began to send the debt collector to disturb me about the payment, they spoilt my credit rating as they reported the case to the credit authority and my credit has been affected by them.If you love your credit report, and don't want to keep on paying extra bills in comparison with what you initially agree, Don't join virgin media.Lastly, when I saw that they've gone a bit further to spoil my credit report, I contacted them to voice out my complain, one of there customer service Listened to my complain and confirmed that my bills have been written off via there online chat service, after 2 weeks of confirming that my bill have been written off, they came back to say that was not what they meant that I still have make payment of Â£102.27. I showed them the evidence that confirms that my bill has been written off, but they said written off means I will have to pay. I wonder how stupid this people are that they taught they are tricking a kid. In conclusion, if you love your credit score and don't want excessive bills after some certain month of joining a network, please Don't attempt joining virgin media  they are liars looking for ways to extort customers.",1.0
7,I was sold a package for 1gb speed and 2 tivo box 6 but when i ask for it they act like i am not given those. Get everything in proper writing. Their sales team are there to just put you on a contract and then they remove what is promised.,2.0
8,"Quite simply you don't get what your sold. For example if you are say switching from BT 67mb package to Virgins 108 mb package you will notice the following.1) Your actual wi fi speeds will more than likely be slower than BT. Id say I got an average of 30mb download speed compared to about 50+ with BT.2) Your wi fi signal from the HUB 3 will not have the range compared to the BT hub 23) Speaking to someone is near impossible unless you book a day off work to sit on the phone on the plus side I found it more reliable than BT but maybe Ive been lucky?",3.0
9,Virgin is just the worse broadband company. Iâve been trying to book an engineer for months and finally got it booked last week for Monday (7th November) and guess what???? I called them on Monday to confirm the visit and they said it wasnât booked,1.0
10,"very rude and unhelpful. I tried to make a complaint, but the call handler refused to put me through to a manager and said âall complaints are through herâ and I wouldnât get a follow up response. I tried to raise a complaint on the website but the link wasnât working.  Iâm incredibly disappointed! Iâve been overcharged, and was promised a Â£68.72 refund. Iâve received Â£14. I cannot face going through another ordeal again.  Virgin you win, but you will never have my business again!",2.0
11,"Absolutely useless service ,no communication and treat the customer the worst I had  received a payment overdue from them a few days ago and all of a sudden they cut my internet connection. I do have a direct debit with them every month which I am paying my monthly bill. had  attached my bank statements to them by email and was expecting  from them  to fix my internet connection promptly and apologise for their mistake or compensate me for all this days that i have to pay from my pocket to have some internet at home but after 5 days nobody communicate with me ,when i try to call them the automatic answer machine says that my account is freezed and have to do the payment for them to be able to unfreeze it Literally i don't have words to express my frustration I will certainly discuss it with my solicitor and get another broadband that cares about their customers",2.0
12,I can't describe how bad is the internet connection 4 weeks now I have to use my mobile data so I can work 3 times I book a appointment for technical services to come and check and 3 times they cancelled and the best is that when I called they said we check and everything is working fine just I don't know what else to do.,2.0
13,"WIFI is usually fast and up to expected speed stated in the package. We used the 200 MB student plan. Occasional service outage especially during heat waves in summer, unfortunately due to the old infrastructure in our area.  Satisfactory customer service. Waiting time is usually around 40 minutes, better than most other companies (for example the energy companies, try not to be a customer of SSE btw). Installation was quick and on time. We were able to cancel the service on the Whatsapp Customer Service, which took about an hour of discrete chat with one of their moving team members. But the response was concise and helpful. Personally I find this reasonable given the huge demand.  It took 3 months for them to send us the self-return package though, although that has not incur any extra charges.",3.0

16,"This company and this service are a joke for the price they make you pay. It's not acceptable that a capital city like London allows this scam game. I've been with them for almost two years.. initially it was kind of okay, but in the last 6 months their service became completely hopeless. I traveled a lot around the world and I never experienced this amount of outage, not even in remote areas. This time I am without broadband since two weeks, and they kept moving the fixing date (they were probably clueless). Today it was supposed to finally get fixed, but guess what.. nothing. I called and they say that the outage in the area has been resolved, but that an ""engineer"" is needed to reconnect the router (magically). Now the story get even funnier. A serious company, after a serious problem like this, would try to push for accelerating the process, but this scam will send an engineer 4 days from now. It's simply not acceptable. They don't care at all about their customers and their service is the worst ever. Plus, if you don't actively call hundred of times they will not update you at all. Fortunately I will leave this service soon. Dear reader, please be aware!",1.0
17,"Disgusting service. They might be a little bit cheaper than sky but my god if you have a problem. Spent the last 3 days on the phone and waited in for the last 2 for an engineer to come out for nobody to come, the customer service reps just keep lying and setting up another appointment to which nobody even arrives. I will not be going with them again just in case I ever have an issue.",1.0
18,"I know it is a slight cliche to say this but I truly would not give any stars for this review and I encourage anyone thinking of using this service to NOT use Virgin Media. It is the 7th week now we have had no internet service. We have been told that the piping holding the cables has collapsed somehow (???) and they are going to come and lay a new cable. Today was the 5th time we waited for the engineer to turn up and again nobody came. It feels like the Customer Service folk are basically lying or do not know what they are saying. It is often the case when you call Customer Service they pass you around until someone creates a fake date when some fake engineers will turn up. So in essence it is a disaster. Its funny when it was working it was fine but now there is a problem, yep they can not or will not deal with it. Luckily our contract has ended, we just joined Sky, instalation in a week with 400 odd new channels. Yep not as fast as Virgin but whats the use of fast broadband when it doesn't work for weeks on end! Oh and whilst we aee waitinf we get full access to Sky Go the app. So yeah when one door closes etc.  Avoid avoid avoid VIRGIN MEDIA",1.0
19,"Would be zero if I could put it. Absolute worst service provider I have ever dealt with. Had it installed and the 20th September and have not had one week of straight service. Had a whole month of no TV service. My partner has had to miss multiple days of work due to no internet and working from home and it is putting his job at risk, not to mention the financial hit we've had to take for him not getting paid as he is not able to work. I would stay very clear because they have a different issue and excuse every week and 6 weeks in still have an outage every week that takes at least 24 hours for them to sort and 24 hours is on a good day. Absolute horrendous experience.",1.0
20,"My contract was coming to an end, and Virgin wanted to increase my price to Â£38.25 per month. After searching, I found more competitive prices. I called Virgin Media to ask if there was anything that they could do with the price, and they went away and said, there was something they could do with the price........... increase it to Â£46 !!!!!!!!! Needless to say, I went elsewhere.",1.0
21,"If you need your broadband urgently, I warn you to stay away from this provider. Their customer service suck. When they want to sell their service, they are nice, friendly and promise a fast delivery. But you definitely WONâT get the service at the scheduled time. They are not RELIABLE. They have been delaying the set-up of my broadband service for two months and they postponed the appointments 4 times without informing me.  2 months ago, I moved to a new house and immediately called Virgin Media to set up my broadband (As I needed the internet connection urgently which is very critical for my job and their Fiber Line was already available for the new house and they just needed to send their technicians to set up the service) And they have rescheduled the appointment 4 times so fa. Hence after two months I still donât have access to the internet. Last month when they rescheduled the set-upt time for the third time, I was so frustrated and called them more than 10 times to get a proper explanation and nobody gave me one but they apologized and promised to set it up today. However, I noticed they postponed the set-up to the next month again (this is the fourth time) and even they havenât bothered to contact me and inform me. Such a shame. Poor service, poor customer support, and poor technical support. There are better providers and I hardly recommend you to subscribe for another broadband service.",1.0
22,"So when we first signed up to virgin your delivery company Yodl weâre absolutely useless and we kept failing to deliver. We couldnât contact them directly and repeated calls to Virgin Customer service proved futile in resolving the matter. This heavily affected our work from home commitments and caused much stress. Eventually I changed the address and we finally received the hub 2-3 weeks late. Then we had a complaint in august and were credited a one-off resolution credit of Â£24 that was never applied. Then I used their customer services three times to resolve it to no avail. 2 phone calls also proved futile. Then I told the customer service agent I will cancel my direct debit as the credit we had been promised (which they said they would send) would cover our last bill. The credit, of course, never arrived. Then we received a late payment charge which is just beyond frustrating and the audacity is unbelievable.  Then I tried to cancel the contract and they point blank kept refusing,Ignoring me and offering me different tariffs.  I have never experienced such horrific customer services from any company ever.  Avoid at all costs Update 30.10.22 - : Virgin Media have now cut us off, despite in our last conversation saying they will resolve the matter and I will receive email confirmation of the resolution. Of course, no email came. If you're looking for a broadband provider, I implore you, do not choose Virgin Media. You will regret it",2.0
23,DO NOT BE FOOLED BY Virgin Media . I have been a loyal customer for years yet they fail to do what they say. I am still awaiting a manager to call me back 3 weeks later nothing! Spoken to a million advisors yet nothing has been resolved! I was promised i would pay Â£44 yet being charged Â£72! What a bloody joke! Just scammers thats what these guys are! Unprofessionals who just want ur money!,2.0
24,"If you value your own time and sanity you will avoid virgin at all costs. I cannot begin to explain the awful experience that I have had with them... The customer service is the worst I have seen. Something as simple as cancelling my services because I moved house ended up with a default on my credit score and lost me the sale of a property. That is a very simple overview of what happened, but I have wasted 6 months of my life trying to sort something so simple and you just get passed from team to team, because apparently none of them are the ""Right team"" to cancel a service. AVOID They have yet again threatened me with charges and are holding me to ransom because they haven't collected their kit... which has been arranged 4 times.",1.0
25,"My personal advice is to stay away from Virgin at all costs. The customer service is so appalling and will drive you to despair. Trust me as well, you will need to call them at some point.We were due to move home as our contract was running out, so I spoke with Virgin, and they were very kind to offer me a temporary 3-month extension on my Wi-Fi. I rang yesterday to now cancel my contract as I am within the 60 days of the end, and they are denying that 3 months exists, and I would have to pay for 18 months.  This despite it clearly showing on my records. They are claiming that I was promised it, but it is not legitimate. Irony is I am not surprised. If you wish to keep your sanity stay away from this company.",2.0
26,"Not even worth 1 star to be honest. Iâm a new customer (1month in) and Iâve been without a phone line, broadband or tv for three days now. Incredibly difficult to get through to a customer service operative and when you finally do, you are fobbed off and/or cut off. The worst customer service experience Iâve ever had. Problem is still not resolved. Do not sign up to Virgin Media, itâs a total waste of money and time. Iâve had BT, Sky and TalkTalk in the past and they were all far superior. Really regret signing a contract with Virgin.",2.0
27,"I'm beginning to believe this is somehow personal, otherwise this shows how really incompetent virgin media is. The moment we left our previous supplier and went with virgin media we have been having issues. The issue started with the lines somehow being crossed, therefore whenever my phone rang so did my neighbours and vice versa which meant we were privy to each others conversations. I should have cancelled immediately.  I live in a small flat, with an average wall separating the area from my broadband box. For years I struggled to get adequate network in my bedroom which would be 12 feet at the most if I could walk through the walls. Countless phone calls and it was still the same. I still stayed! During the Covid lockdown and just as it was easing I wanted to have access to local news etc as I was only watching catch ups... I called virgin and settled on a plan for broadband, telephone and virgin media, with promises that the broadband strength would increase, needless to say I still had the same issues. In addition for whatever reason at the time virgin media was not connected.  Virgin continued with the same plan, collecting the same amount despite not setting up virgin media. I don't know why I persisted with virgin but I did. Recently I've had enough and decided that they're either gonna do better or I'm gonna switch. They gave me hell to get my number, a number which does not belong to them as I moved over to them with my number from my previous supplier. In any event, that number is used as a business number so we cannot just let it go. After all the trouble and stress of the process we relented again and decided to stay as it was creating so many issues and anxiety. We again agreed on a plan for virgin media again, broadband and telephone. While the network has improved my telephone has stopped working. About two weeks ago an engineer was scheduled to do the TV, but claimed he could not because he wasn't sure he could do a good enough job of not having wires everywhere. We were then offered a streaming box. That would work without wire connection, but that would mean one box when the agreement was to have two boxes installed. I requested another engineer come out as the other one really didn't seem to walk to take the work on. The agreed time was for 9am a few days later. 9am came and went, it was not until about 4pm after multiple phone calls that the engineer came, while i stayed home from work to accommodate that visit. We had a run through of the property, came up with a plan that was suitable and was promised a call to arrange installation. It's been over a week and I'm still waiting for that phone call!!! Virgin is gonna send me a bill for over Â£115 when I have no phone and definitely no tv!!!! An engineer was meant to visit today at 4pm to fix the phone line and should I say I'm still waiting, or is it safe to go ahead and stop waiting? I'm also still waiting for a senior personnel to give me a ring. I contacted virgin WhatsApp chat and as I type I'm still waiting almost two hours to be connected to an agent. Is it that I'm too patient, gullible, stupid or all of the above.  Virgin media you are the worst company I've had the misfortune of letting into our home!",1.0
28,Vey bad company!! Please stay away from them! Today is another day i cannot work from home because they couldnt sort it out their broadband issue inmy area since July!!! 4 months! They have also rubbish customer service. Paying Â£65 per month and cannot get any service from them!,1.0

30,"Virgin broadband or virgin media have to be one of the worst service providers in the UK. Yeah they provide fast Internet but if it works less than half the time what the point? Their customer service is even worse, you make a complaint and they don't contact you back and just close the complaint and mark it as resolved. If a company is taking your money and not providing the service in return, surely this is a Scam?!  Go with anyone else, or just get two cups and a peice of string if you need something reliable.",2.0
31,I rate the service 0. This is the worst customer service I have experienced. It was a simple issue that we needed resolving due to them taking wires out without our consent. Then they we have to wait 2 weeks for this to be rectified. We got placed on long holds or the advisor would be silent for minutes on end. Got passed to complaints to just be hung up on before speaking to anyone and constant service from everyone was appalling. Glad we ended up not going with this provider.,2.0
32,"I signed up for broadband and TV in August.  Already facing problems. No TV and broadband since Fri. My daughter have gcse and my other daughter works from home. When called they said it can be 30 days. When called customer services, they said nothing we can do. Except wait for engineer.i wish I had never signed up to virgin. I had never gone without Internet or TV with bt and sky. Big mistake and bog blunder.  I wouldn't even give one star",1.0
33,Virgin Media has become dreadful and it's customer service is appalling.,1.0
34,"We secured a good deal with Virgin media for broadband in 2020. As soon as our contract ended (June 2022) they hiked our prices up by almost 100%. I called to explain that it was unaffordable, I'd also been made redundant and financially we were struggling. The rep at Virgin was completely uninterested and offered a ""take it or leave"" amount that still resembled an 80% increase on our original tariff. I therefore chose to switch service providers which we did, then called Virgin to cancel and they made it as difficult as humanly possible to do this - the women in the cancellations department actually argued that it was our fault for not being more proactive in reviewing our contract pricing. Another sign we had made the right choice by leaving. I then received multiple calls each day over a week from Virgin sales reps offering prices better than our original package, must've been shy on sales targets but nowhere to be seen when I reached out... Obviously by this point we're already with a new provider so it wasn't possible. They then issued an outstanding payment notice claiming we had to give 30 days notice to cancel and slapped a ""late payment fee"" on top of the value of the unjustifiably hiked tariff. Despite being out of contract. This is the corporate equivalent of bullying - Virgin see us as consumers, not people. Numbers not individuals. The value of the outstanding amount means nothing to Virgin Media, but might mean something to an individual. Do they care? Absolutely not. They are only interested in your pockets so just be wary if you go with them. My advice would be not to following what's been a pretty inhumane and disgraceful experience. Judging by their score here, it's pretty consistent too. Too busy building ""rockets"". What a joke.",1.0
35,"Worst company I have ever deal with. I signed up to a contract which offer an introductory discount. After I had placed my order, virgin media did not honour the discount. I complained multiple times and these emails contained cut and paste responses, but nothing helpful. They said they were unable to find anything which confirmed the offer on their end and after sending them a copy of the contract they had sent to me, they ignored my emails. In addition, they repeatedly got my name wrong in the replies on webchat and some emails. I asked for a letter of deadlock which was ignored and I asked them to cancel my services which they also ignored. Luckily I have now managed to cancel my contract via a telephone call which was also unnecessarily complicated but I have learnt my lesson. Do not go with the cheapest company, they are cheap for a reason. It is worth it to pay a bit extra to get good customer service. I am also in the process of complaining to CISAS as virgin media are knowingly falsely advertising their products.",2.0

37,"Absolutely shocking, I have in the middle of my contract with Virgin and can't wait for it to end.  I run 3 devices, my phone, firestick and laptop.  I can't watch anything on firestick for longer than 10 minutes without buffering, my laptop constantly loses network connection and I can't view my cameras on my phone because of the signal.I reboot router around 5 times a day and still get buffering.  I've had countless engineers out and still rubbish. Last call was this morning, buffering, their solution, pay another Â£8 a month on top of the Â£30 I already get to get a WiFi booster, no thanks.

There's no way to cancel without talking to someone. The service is unreliable, cutting out several times in the last year. I also have concerns about their security.

42,"Honestly not sure how to describe this broadband without many not permitted words but will try.  Customer service- donât care and take 30 minutes to answer every callBroadband - never near recommended speed and always intermittent Other - big brown box on outside of the wall, great attraction for kids to come and kick apart, which happened several times Thatâs the basics but in more detail, they once turned my internet off for 3 days, it wasnât a fault, they turned it off and no one ever could explain why.  They setup the account in the wrong name, but wouldnât change it as they would only speak to the account holder who didnât exist, eventually someone saw sense and sorted it out but took 4 calls (again min 30 minute hold time each call).  Advertised speed 50-70GB, but regularly delivering under 5, customer service excuse was using a device on Wi-Fi. As a comparison I only have wifi connections now using EE and always get at least 70GB download speed.  They increased my bill from what was agreed, within the contract which again took another 30 min hold to sort with someone who again didnât care and I had to provide proof of the original agreement.  I can honestly say Iâve never dealt with anything or any company this bad for anything ever.",2.0

48,"2.5 weeks ago I called to rejoin with virgin media in my new address. I made a 18 month contract for broadband and I have been told Iâll receive my installation plug in box on Tuesday 20/09/2022.I have been told that the property has been provided with fiber before so there will be all the available plugs to connect your broadband and start using your services. A week after I get a call from one of the providers trying to offer me virgin media packages. After I informed the customer service that I already have an ongoing order place and that my box is late for delivery he informed me that there is no order under this name. I provided my account details and I sent my contract so he can check and he can verify that the account exist in the order is there. Eventually he found the order and he apologized as the person I spoke before forgot to do the credit check so the order never been through. I never got an email that the order is not been through or is cancel I just had a contract in my email saying that the delivery is going to be on that Tuesday. He informed me then that this order has to be canceled and a new order has to be placed so after providing all my details again a new your order was placed. They told me cause the offer I booked wasnât available anymore and I should book a new deal which was 5 pounds extra monthly. I told him that didnât want to continue so they offer me the package I had before. After the order was gone through I check the contract and they set the wrong delivery address after I specifically specified that I would like my box to be delivered to a different address. After calling again I managed to change the delivery address and I finally received the installation box. However the installation box doesnât include the appropriate plugs to connect the broadband and the technician has to come to sort my broadband connection. I asked when can this happen and the only available slot for the technician is next week on Thursday 06/10 for which I have to take a day off from work so I can be home . I really cannot understand the whole process and how unprofessional and Company like this can be. I asked for the technician to be around this week but they told me that it has to be booked end it takes a week.

Sadly my mum died last year which I informed virgin media of and they allowed me to continue paying the bill on her account. I got tired of paying this expensive bill and cancelled the account. They came to pick up their broadband box and said I would get a refund of what was owed to me in the next couple of weeks. I then received a cheque in my mumâs name. I called virgin media to ask them to put the cheque in my name as my mum has been dead for over a year and they tell me I need power of attorney. Unfortunately I couldnât get this before my mum died, so someone named Ren in customer service says thereâs nothing she can do.How am I supposed to get power of attorney for a dead person! Virgin media have been perfectly happy taking my money for the last year even though theyâve known the account holder has been dead. All Iâve asked for is for the cheque to be made out to me and theyâve said they canât do that.How can I pay for an account, cancel an account, talk to customer service about an account but they canât change the name on a cheque? I also donât understand why no one informed me to change the name on my mumâs account until after the account has been cancelled??Iâve paid them over a grand in the last year and this is not how you treat a customer of over 10Years.

58,"It should be as easy to unsubscribe from a service as it is to sign up. Other than powerful brand bullies, who is against this? I gladly signed up with Virgin Media for an eighteen month broadband contract in March 2021. The process was rapid, the price very competitive (until my deal ended, when it became absurdly UN-competitive, but I knew that going in) and the service good. When fibre broadband was installed in my area there was no way Virgin or any other traditional provider would be able to compete, so, playing along with the unnecessarily restrictive rules about their timing of cancellations (read the small print) I took an afternoon off to unsubscribe (thanks to feedback I was prepared). Cancelling requires a seemingly inescapable charade of aggressive renegotiation (just offer me your best price upfront please, we don't live in some medieval bazaar). I was then hassled for weeks with ""better"" offers at all hours of the day from a variety of different phone numbers, making it difficult to block. For reasons known only to Virgin, my service was cancelled four days before my contract ended and I was, ludicrously, billed a few pounds for an early disconnection charge. Because the company had proved so inconvenient to negotiate with regarding cancellation, I paid it, which is presumably their bad faith strategy. Then, I was almost immediately threatened with further billing despite returning my Virgin Media equipment within 24 hours of receiving their packaging (now resolved, but we'll see). I kept transcripts of exchanges, and am advising other existing customers to do the same, as the culture demonstrated suggests they are not to be trusted. I can't imagine what it would be like dealing with Virgin Media in case of bereavement or other personal crisis. If anyone from Virgin ever reads this, please know: It is unlikely that making it extremely inconvenient to turn off the service is going to dissuade someone from doing it. It hurts a once respected brand, will demotivate your employees and destroys loyalty. It is short term-thinking and depressingly lazy. But you do it anyway. Just look at the reviews amassing on Trustpilot. When organizations get too big and too short-term focused to pay attention to the market, itâs a perfect moment for consumers to band together and give them a guardrail. If I can sign up with a few clicks, I should be able to withdraw my custom with a few clicks. I rent my London flat, so when I move I may not have fibre broadband as an option, and will likely require another provider. It won't be Virgin Media, and a once loyal customer will now repeat this complaint across any platforms that allow me to leave a review. Pity.",4.0

They use this opportunity to get me to add just a couple of pounds a month onto the contract as a lesser evil to the massive price hike. They then do the same at the end of the contract but they almost double the price so that they can add an extra fiver. These conversations are the most stress inducing conversations I have ever encountered with any company, they are horrendous. I have mental health problems almost every time I hear from this company as it is almost always an argument to get my prices lowered. I honestly can't express how horrible this company is, they are manipulative and use dirty tactics to steal from the consumer. I just got off my final call with them and I have terminated my contract (As they wanted to add Â£10 to my monthly contract and wouldn't budge). I was told by the nice sounding geordie on the other end of the phone that the company has to make profits and that they will always raise the price of your contract. I pointed out the record profits of virgin media and asked why these weren't passed onto the consumer, he said that is just how companies work. I do not want to be part of an organisation that makes record profits and still charge their consumer more money based on the cost of living going up.

79,"Disappointing Braodband and even bigger disappointment with regards to customer service. I have been a Virgin Media broadband customer for three years previously in a different city and it was great. No problems at all. Unfortunately in Brighton the Broadband was awful and when I reported the slow speeds and the constant cutting out I was made to feel very small and incompetent. Virgin Media were not interested in the slightest and just kept saying that their end said there werenât any issues. They eventually sent out an engineer who also didnât resolve anything and just told us we were at the end of the line. To finish it off when my contract was up  Virgin wanted a Â£40 early disconnection fee as my tenancy was for a month less than my Broadband contract. I decided to just pay the 12 months despite no longer being at the property. I was then contacted asking if I would terminate the contract early as someone else was moving into the property but I declined to pay the early disconnection fee. The person was quite insistent despite me making it obvious that their timing was most inconvenient and I asked if they could ring back at a more convenient time. They didnât ring again that evening as requested. I then rang them back to clarify what was going on and again I was asked if I wanted to pay the early disconnection fee, yet again I declined their kind offer to pay more money for a service I was no longer using. Then out if the blue I received a final bill saying that my contract had been terminated without any consultation with myself. When I queried the bill I was told by the young man, I wonât name him as itâs probably not allowed, that Virgin Media could basically do whatever they liked with the contract or words to that effect and when I queried this statement he reneged and denied saying it, although sounding a little flustered. So disappointed this year with the poor service received after three previous contracts that went without any hitches at all.

Unhappy with this, I told them I would find an alternative provider which I did. Despite various phone calls to Virgin and discussions with them via Twitter, they failed to tell me I had to give 30 days cancellation until I called today to tell them I am now with Talk Talk and this is despite not even being in a contract. They basically told me it was my own fault for not being aware of the T&C's and not reading their cancellation policy. So now they intend to charge me for broadband I won't be using for the next month as its been disconnected when I moved to Talk Talk. Had they informed me of this when I first told them I was leaving, I could have cancelled 3 weeks ago.Disgusting company, appalling customer service and clearly have no value for customers.

Virgin did not instal the service on 20/06, instead rescheduled the instal to 01/07 and again failed to install the services on 01/07 without any communication or warning. I contacted Virgin numerous times asking for help as my Broadband contract expired on 30/06 and had no help offered so we purchased a dongle as we both work from home. I worked from friends' places and my wife worked off the dongle. I contacted them numerous times to speak to a senior manager and lodge a complaint with no success. As a consequence, I contacted EE on 04/07following my struggle of two months with Virgin and had every date met from kit delivery to BB installation. So in less then 12 days from the order I had a service provide which Virgin was uncapable of delivering in two months+. After the failed installation on 01/07. I contacted virgin numerous times and was given the 4th for cable instal with service activation to follow which was then pushed out to 08/07, then on the 8th, since nobody turned up I was given no further dates, just a plain statement that it will happen before 18/07 as the service will be activated on 18/07. Coincidentally a team turned up today to install the cable to the property, but I have today 14/07 cancelled the installation as I have lost confidence in their customer service, do not want to have the continued stress and uncertainty.

185,"I would happily give zero stars, in every way for everything.My late mother had virgin and she unfortunately passed away in December. I call to notify them in January and was given two options. Either carry on with her existing contract OR become a âNew Customerâ. As she was a long standing customer she managed to secure a very good package deal. So I agreed to continue under those terms and gave over my bank details. However it has been anything but a smooth ride.Having to make contact, on average; monthly, as the direct debit amount was not correct and/or services not working.This came to ahead in March 22 when I received a bill for double the agreed amount. I called and was informed that the amount to be debited from my account was not that amount, this was showing as they had not made a manual credit adjustment in time.Direct debit date comes around and they take that larger amount. I called again and demanded my money back. I was directed to make an Indemnity claim at the bank, which I did.Then in April I received a bill with an even larger balance.I was persuaded by a virgin media sales rep that all my problems would go away if I took out a new package as I wasnât actually on a contract - which incurs a charge, there was no direct debit set up - which incurs another fee. So I set up as a new customer and there was a very detailed conversation about amounts to be paid and credits and account closures.Suffice to say I sought another provider and had them come and install actual fibre to my property, not a glorified broadband speed. To then be told that itâs virgins standard procedure to charge a month in advance. This was never outlined to me at all during an hours telephone conversation.So I called to close everything down. And even though Iâm not in contract, or at this point, even using their service (every virgin piece of equipment was unplugged and set to the side) and that I would need to arrange for their equipment to be sent back or they are going to charge me Â£65.00.Cut to now. Having spent 36 hours in their chat queue and it is only now that o have managed to get a complaint officially raised.I am now left with a motorways length of cable at my house which is draped through my guttering, stuffed under hedges and worse - a tripping hazard as pointed out by the new providers independent regional installation team. No wonder the service was so shoddy it was never installed properly. I will never have any Virgin Media product in my house again. And now they have merged with O2 - with whom my family have been loyal customers for years. We are also in the process of switching all mobile contracts and services to another provider. I will now actively discourage people to sign up with virgin media and I will leave negative reviews at any given opportunity so that people are aware just how this disgraceful and inept this organisation is.BEWARE of virgin media. They are quick to take your money and make their demand for it.

There are three downsides to virgin however.  1.Price hikes - these happen yearly and are always at inflation + an extra percentage.  Inflation I can acept, but the added percentage is a rip off.   2. Supplied Router - The superhub 3 or the more modern 4 are dire. They need regular rebooting (which takes about 5 mins to complete) and the wifi coverage is terrible. If you choose to go with virgin, an aftermarket router is a must (a huawei ax3 costs aboutr Â£30 and massivly improves performance).   3. Customer service is terrible.  Most agents seem to be based in Asia and comminicating with them is hard, and they seem only to be trained to follow a script.

229,"Absolutely appalling customer service from Virgin Media. We've had their broadband service for a few years then contacted them a week before we exchanged contracts for our recent move. The person we spoke with told us we could take our existing Virgin Hub with us to our new home, and the next day after the move plug it in and our service will continue.  This turned out to be a lie. It didn't work so we spent an hour waiting to get hold of someone and when we did they stated that we were given incorrect information and that we needed an engineer to visit and install for us.  So, we decided to cancel our contract and return our hub... we've endured patchy customer service over the years from Virgin Media and thought we'd take the opportunity to go with BT instead. Contract cancellation was confirmed on the phone with Virgin Media and we also then cancelled our Direct Debit. A few weeks later, they send us a new hub, which we put to one side thinking they'll then twig they didn't need to send it then ask us to send it back. They're so disjointed as a business that it's still sitting in our dining room awaiting collection. But the sting for us is that a few months later we receive a debt agency collection communication that we owe Virgin Media moneyâ¦ which we don't as we cancelled and it was confirmed on the phone by a Virgin agent. We've now spent a few hours over the last fortnight calling and communicating with Virgin, asking them to listen to the phone recordings, and then cancel this debt that we don't owe. Eventually, we speak with someone who states that we did owe for a disconnection notice and we agreed we'd pay it. It was Â£61. We've now been presented with a bill for Â£82, more than the amount agreed. It's just insane. We're both self-employed so spending more time chasing Virgin is time we could be spending on billable activity for our business. So, what do we do? Pay it and put it down to experience? Just leave it, and see if the Debt Collection Agency comes back again? I've never experienced anything like this and I'm hoping that someone senior in Virgin Media will see this and other posts and actually initiate some change within the organisation. Each department is like a silo, operating independently of other departments. Why they can't get aligned and actually offer a joined-up customer service is ironic, given they're in the communications sector. I never want to use Virgin Media again and indeed it puts me off potentially using other Virgin branded services.

They failed to give me 30 days notice (legal requirement) that the fees would increase from Â£27 per month to Â£51.

They told me there wouldn't be so I signed up with another provider and rang back 5 days later to cancel my virgin account.

Called them to find out that they know nothing about changed date and didn.t care that I could send them screenshots as evidence. They insisted on their date. I was off sick so I thought, whatever, I can wait. On the day engineer arrived at the very last minute of agreed time and said he wont be able to install the line as he knows that there is no one around to give him access to cupboard with thee internet lines and that he explained it to the head office before to set different time slot. Next day I received text + email informing me that the next available date will be in 2 weeks!!! I decided to call them and that's where hell broke loose. Apparently I supposed to have ""phone password"" to be able to identify myself. I told them that I cant remember setting one. I got internet account, set security question but couldn't remember setting anything for a phone. They were using secondary verification until I had enough and declared that I changed my mind and want to cancel installation/contract. They said I have to call different number which when I called was out of use. Called them again on normal line and they disconnected me 4 times after learning that I want to cancel and don't know my phone password. Called once more and asked how can I reset this password. They replied that its not possible as there is no option for it, not online nor over the phone... I asked then that this mean that I have been put in the limbo and have no way to leave them or even complain as I have no means to contact them, btw, if you try to inform them about leaving online you will end up on error 404 website... They declared that I can request a letter with reminder of my password which I agreed to... 2 weeks ago! My guess is it comes on a donkey from India as that's where their call centres are located. Cherry on the cake was a phone call from them after I replied to text informing me that next day will be my installation day, and declining to it. The guy was trying to set another date after I told him that I do not want it and I'm trying to cancel the whole thing! He couldn't understand what I am saying to him and it really started to feel like I am on the line with one of these scam call centres. I told him to go and find my letter and finished the call.

302,"Doesn't deserve even one star!!!!!!!  I have been with Virgin media for 17 years and have recently moved to my new house in December 2021. The move obviously is always stressful but what has made this worst for me is my decision to move my services with me. Itâs been 6 weeks now and having spent countless hours over phone and having had several visits to property by technicians/surveyors and having spoken to countless people/agents and having paid more money and several cancelled/rescheduled appointments, I am still without Internet and media services till date with no solution in sight!!!!! Not only are there long waits to speak to an agent and frequent call drops but they are also not trained and lack knowledge and there is absolutely no coordination between various teams. Some agents have been insulting and rude. Their lack of knowledge has resulted in me getting false and misleading information and has caused me extreme anxiety and inconvenience. Each agent I have spoken to has given me different information which contradicted the information from previous agent and each one of them say that the previous agent has given wrong information. Majority of the times I was just being transferred from one team to other and would go through security checks 10 times and keep repeating myself every time when transferred to a new agent in a call. This is extremely frustrating and i firmly believe that no customer should go through such an experience! I thought I may have been an exception but reading other reviews posted clearly highlights that the company does not care about customers anymore and wouldn't pay any attention to issues/complaints. I strongly suggest not to consider Virgin media if you do not want to go through torture and harassment. Sharing few of my life experiences (or rather absolute harassment)!!!! There have been several days when I have made 10 calls or more, waited and spent more than 8/9 hours in a day, spoken to more than 15 agents in a day! Logged an official complaint for hassling customers, miscoordination (Internal installation & external installation team/ Movers & Preinstallation team), mis informing customers and appalling customer services 2 weeks ago but have not heard anything back from anyone, not even an acknowledgement! Installation was initially scheduled for 17th Dec but couldn't be carried out as the cable has been pulled up by Construction Unit to a wrong place. Since then, trying to rectify the simple issue as above has been more difficult than reaching Mars! One of the calls to report this issue- the Agent promptly cancelled the order and hung the phone without any proper discussions The installation was moved to 12th Jan (earliest) which meant no services in our new home for 3 weeks specially during holidays! One of the agents said that mobile dongle would be provided free to ensure we have internet during Xmas and asked me to speak to Mobile team which was an absolute nightmare as all agents subsequently refuted each other and told me to buy it! Another agent when followed up in December (20-24th Dec) said that the external team has gone again and fixed the issue that morning, but this was untrue as the issue was still unresolved. Not sure why these agents are forced to lie perhaps to placate or get rid of the call soon!? To summarise, there is an issue with how External installation team has left the cable and all the calls I have made and countless hours I have spent since then is to get this corrected because the internal installation team would not be able to do anything until this is fixed and I will keep experiencing this pain until then and would not have any services too!!!ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE!!!! Hope someone, somewhere in the system takes a note of how far the customer services have deteriorated and how much pain it is causing the customers but, in the interim, would strongly suggest everyone to consider Virgin Media only if you are not left with any other option!!!!!",2.0

I even requested another router which was refused. So unable to use the service as you didn't supply hardware I spent HOURS and I have proof trying to sort this mess out with you17:11, Jan 6 You: I couldn't use a service without the hardware so why would I stay with a provider that cannot provide?17:29, Jan 6 You: here I am again over 90 mins repeating myself and getting nowhere17:29, Jan 6 Meena: I am sorry to know about the hassle which you have come across Alistair, I feel really bad after going through all these and you have been so patient so far. Dont worry I will see what best can be done for you.

I have tried my best Alistair, but unfortunately we cannot waive off the charges as you have been able to use the services and itcould have been resolved alternatively. But as you have cancelled it between contract, you was been charged with disconnection fee Alistair.17:46, Jan 6 You: Did you not read the information i poasted??17:52, Jan 6 Meena: Okay where you not informed that you will be charged termination fee if you are cancelling the contract Alistair?18:00, Jan 6 Meena: Alistair, we booked for the second time and you never waited for the delivery to be sent, you immediately put a request for disconnection Alistair. Please understand this charges cannot be removed as itsvalid from our end.18:03, Jan 6 You: no, i made contact with VM as you had not even bothetred to disptach the second one.

I tried to do this using the online system but it did not support cancellation. I tried using the online chat function but they kept me waiting until I lost the will to live. I emailed Virgin who insisted that I phone their retention team. I tried to phone the retention team and sat in a phone queue until my patience was exhausted. I lodged a complaint through the Virgin Complaints process and asked to be contacted by email. Virgin phoned me while I was driving and left a message asking me to call them. I tried and sat in another phone queue for a while. I kept emailing with no success so took the case to CEDR (meanwhile, Virgin were still debiting the monthly bills for as service that I was not receiving). I received an offer from Virgin as follows:- ""Â£250.00 compensation, as a gesture of goodwill....Cancel your services free of charge. Once again, please accept my apologies for the inconvenience caused as a result of the delay in cancelling your services"". It was now 29/7/21 so I reluctantly accepted expecting the money to be credited to my account. Nothing happened so I followed up and Virgin told me that it was company policy to only offer refunds by cheque. I eventually received a cheque for Â£250 but Virgin were still debiting my account Â£25.85 per month. I received approximately 10 calls from the Virgin Retention team asking if there was anything they could do to retain my business. My account was cancelled in Sept but my money was not refunded and Virgin does not accept complaints from cancelled accounts so I went back to CEDR and raised a further complaint. Virgin challenged this under CEDR terms and conditions saying that a complaint cannot be accepted if it relates to a previous complaint. I responded saying that Virgin had failed to properly deal with the previous complaint but CEDR upheld Virgin's position. I shall also be lodging a complaint against CEDR.",1.0

362,"The standard of customer service that I have recently received from Virgin Media ranks among the worst experiences I have ever endured when dealing with any business. I made contact to arrange a home move, aware of the fact that there were likely to be complications as I would be staying with friends temporarily whilst between addresses.  I was informed within this conversation that there was no mechanism within Virgin Media's contracts to pause in such an event, despite this being a very commonplace occurrence. As the contract could not be transferred to my temporary accommodation, I was informed that it would be terminated as soon as new residents commenced a contract at my previous address.  As I had no desire to end this contract and had every intention of transferring it to my new permanent address or recommencing at the new address, I requested that the termination fee be waived. I was told bluntly that this was not an option and that no level of management would have the authority to waive the fee.  I have spoken to multiple members of the home move and customer service team but have been unable to speak to a manager at any point. I was promised a call back from a manager at 9am the following day. This never materialised.  When I called back to request the promised conversation with a manager, I was informed that a manager had tried to call at 9.40am. This was absolutely untrue. After multiple conversations with further members of customer service staff, I was informed that the aforementioned manager would try to call again and that another manager would ring me back within 72 hours.  These calls have again not occurred one week later.  My account has been terminated with no written notice, I found this out only because I logged into my online Virgin Media portal to find that my account had been closed. My Virgin Mobile account, which was directly associated with my Virgin Media account, stills works, but I have been given no information about the terms and conditions of this ongoing service.  All in all, this has been an appalling experience as a customer, leaving me to pay a significant fee despite having actively sought to remain with Virgin Media.

They frequently lie about their services: if you download the app it promises to ""optimise"" the wifi for you to eliminate blackspots. This makes absolutely no difference to your actual connection, and yet they still claim to have improved it every single time.

After a while we literally had to call them every month as they kept trying to up our direct debit without letting us know. Some months it would go from Â£50 to Â£85!

We were quoted Â£147 to be able to cancel and leave them, we wanted to pay it over the phone but we couldnât and had to wait for it to be taken out of the bank account by them. I have unplugged the tv box and turned the WiFi router and phone off just so that we knew there wouldnât be any additional charges made up by them.

That was the moment i decided i need to quit their service but surprise surprise, i need to pay an early disconnection fee of 150GBP. So they cause me the problem, they force me to quit their service and they want to charge me an early disconnection fee. This is the real hustle.

477,"Where to begin? (Clue - dont even think about signing up. Move on, find a different provider). The below letter, should give you an idea of our nightmare. (Despite my complaint being logged they threatened us with court action if we didnt pay the withheld Â£167 cancelation fee. Not wanting a bad credit reference we gave in to their bullying tactics to be free of them  and peace of mind. Deplorable treatment of ""customers"". Account no: xxxxxxxx Regarding the above account number at the address of xxxxxx Road, EN5 xxx. From your letter dated 12 Feb I see that we have been charged Â£167.92 cancelation fee.Let me explain why we will not be paying this.The service provided by Virgin Media has been not fit for purpose. We both work from home. Both of us found that our laptops kept disconnecting from the wifi, our Teams and Zoom calls kept dropping. This was embarrassing and unacceptable, not to mention we both lost work we had spent a lot of time on.  We called many times, to lodge complaints and try and get Virgin to do something about it. However, after listening to answering machine messages and dreadful muzak for hours we were usually cut off, or, if someone did answer, then they said they would put us through to someone else, and then we were cut off! As you can imagine, having an internet service that keeps cutting you off is one thing, but when the service provider keeps cutting you off as well, when you try and speak to them, well, thatâs the final straw. So over many months we probably spent a small fortune on phone calls, and got through only once I believe to lodge a complaint. We had an engineer round who did nothing else than apologise but the service did not improve, although once I did manage to remain on a video call for almost 25 minutes before I was disconnected.Very frustrating, when the service you pay for doesnât work and the service provider is not available to listen to your issues. So nothing changed. In the end, both myself and my wife, bought, at our own expense, data packages for both our mobile phones, and used these to connect our laptops to in order to be able to work from home. So as you can see, the service provided by Virgin, such that it was, was not fit for the purpose that we intended it for. Secondly, we had little ability to make contact with the service provider to raise the issue. When we did manage to get through, nothing was done. We have had to pay a second service provider to provide the service that we were already paying Virgin to provide.  I believe we were in fact miss-sold this broadband service by Virgin as the quality was clearly not good enough for daily use and its intended purpose. Therefore, we will not be paying your cancellation fee, and are considering notifying trading standards to recover further costs we have paid to Virgin for a service that we were miss-sold, that was not usable as intended and that Virgin did nothing to remedy. We are now with BT and have no issues at all. Moreover, when we call them, someone actually answers the phone.  Regards,  Lukas Tatek.",1.0
478,Terrible customer service. OK until something goes wrong and you're left waiting on a call or online chat for hours with no resolution. In my experience their advice is contradictory as i was told one thing and then after being on a call for over 2 hours was told something completely different. Completely unhelpful and a huge waste of time. Submitting a complaint about begin kept waiting for hours at a time also gets you nowhere as their only resolution they offer is that internal feedback will be provided. Infuriating is an understatement. Avoid at all costs!,2.0

482,"The customer service at Virgin media has been the worst experience of my entire life. They give you false promises and never deliver! I was moving home and called the 1 month in advance to tell them if I can take my Virgin media to my new home. Here the caller gave me the first bit of false home and told me they will send out a spotter who will contact me in 5 days to tell me if they can supply Virgin media in that area or not. The caller also confidently said that I can take my Virgin media with me and therefore I shouldn't sort out another internet provider. 2 weeks go by and I haven't heard anything so I call back. Here I get the second bit of false hope as they firstly acknowledge that the spotter still has not come out so they told me they will send another one out and should be contacted in 5 days. It has now been a 6 weeks with no contact since my initial call and I am left without internet at my new property. Now, another beautiful problem with Virgin media is there cancellation fee. I want to take Virgin media with me but after speaking to them on the phone they tell me I cannot get Virgin media at my place. Clearly this is due to their spotters not contacting anyone. Nevertheless, to know fault of my own, I want to take my services to my new location however they are the ones failing to provide the services. But guess what? I am the one who has to pay Â£162 in cancellation fees! Whoopee for me. So I don't get any internet at my new accommodation with 6 weeks notice to them and get a hefty fee along with it as they are unable to provide me service. All the meanwhile I have spoken to 6 different callers all with zero empathy. One caller also even left me on hold for 30 minutes before disconnectinh me and never to hear back from again. The Â£160 loss is heavy for me as I am a student. However, the thousands they will lose from me as a future customer and my friends and familys is a bigger loss to them.

484,"Never AgainToday I cancelled my contract and opted to pay the cancellation fee due to the absolutely awful WiFi connection. This, only after about 3 months with Virgin Media. Speeds have been as low as 1.00 mbps download with 0.03 mbps upload anywhere in the house except in the room in which the media box is located (just retested and 5.51 mbps download and 0.07 mbps upload). This, the advisors at Virgin Media (Virgin) say, is what Virgin are contracted to provide and are therefore fulfilling their part of the contract. The only guarantee Virgin provide for full speed, in my case 108 mbps download and 10 mbps upload, is if a device is connected using a ethernet cable. How archaic is this? No apologies provided by the advisors to whom I spoke, just a reiteration of the fact the contract is being met and a suggestion to purchase a booster for each room. Yes, boosters would have been cheaper than cancellation, but on principle the situation is unacceptable and not fair treatment for the customer. I did not have guaranteed WiFi in each room with my previous provider BT, in fact I only had download speeds of 14 mpbs, but yet I was able to comfortably attend virtual meetings, stream Netflix, YouTube and other services with limited interruption. If Virgin's speeds were comparable to what I was getting from BT, I would have been frustrated but sucked it up. How anywhere near 1.00 mbps could be acceptable however and brushed off with a suggestion to pay an additional monthly charge for boosters is just unfathomable. How is this company regulated? How do they get away with treating customers in this way? It's easy to explain contractual terms but surely this must be measured against providing the best service possible to customers. Unfortunately, nothing about this service has been good. I never write a review but this is one I will shout from the mountain top to anyone who will listen.

I signed up for 200mbps and I can only get this in the room where the router is - virtually nothing upstairs when it has always been fine before - I was sent a booster which you have to pay extra for when this service is not fit for purpose and other providers give these free.

He said he would restore it, but then simply left without fixing it. Result: from 16h Monday to now we've had no internet.

So all this time, no internet, no work - just a borrowed WIFI and our 3gs to do the bare minimum. Already unacceptable. As if it wasn't enough, they didn't show up to their appointment (which I've been waiting since 8am). Instead, they called me once (while I was in the middle of a meeting).

What am I expecting. So I waited 2 further weeks thinking I'll get a letter, an email, phone call or something to say what the delay is for, roughly how long, I heard nothing from them, so I phoned up myself to see what's going on. I explained I purchased on February, for march install, and we're in mid April and I've heard nothing, he explained about road works needed permission to dig up, which I totally agree and knew about, hence why I ordered way in advanced, so he said could I give it until end of April , I said yeah sure no problem  Anyway end of April comes, again, nothing , no text, email , phone, letter.

563,"Firstly, for the actual service, I was with Virgin Media for 2 years. The deal was the most competitively priced for 100mbps speeds. Throughout those two years the internet speeds never felt great, many days I would check the speed and it would be below 10mbps. Virginâs terms and conditions make it difficult to challenge drops in speed. On the 27th March I switched provider to get 67mbps speeds for the same price, and honestly, the service has been far better and consistent. Now to share my story at how awful it has been to move my services. Middle of March 2021, I contact virgin via the web chat to make them aware Iâm moving homes. They tell me they cannot offer 100mbps at the new home, that is fine, I put in a cancelation request. A few days later, I get a call from Virgin telling me I can get those speeds at the new home and they offer me a good deal, I accept and share my details, such as my moving date, the 27th March. 20th March, Virgin Media terminate my existing broadband, 7 days too early. Leaving me to have to purchase and use Data in order to do my job. To get reconnected took 4 hours 14 minutes (14 at least different calls). Why so many calls? I would be reconnected to another department rather often, and just less than half the time, my call would be disconnected while being transferred. This happened roughly a dozen times from start to finish. I was reconnected after 4 days without broadband.  While the team helped me get reconnected, they brought it to my attention that the there is also a problem with the new property I asked to move my broadband to. They have to do some building work to get the broadband up to speed and this would take between 4-8 weeks, they said they would supply me with a dongle in the meantime. They gave me a number I had to text in order to sort out the dongle. I text the number it led to a conclusion that someone would call me within 24 hours to sort out the dongle. No one called. I text the number again, same conclusion someone will get back in touch. No one called. I text the number again, same conclusion someone will get back in touch. While this was going on, I was still phoning virgin to get reconnected, since it was a 4-day ordeal. While trying to get reconnected, I finally threw in the towel and said I donât want any services from Virgin anymore, I would like to leave. The dongle was given up on as well. I went with a new provider EE, who have been great so far.  My final date with Virgin media was the 27th March. I got a letter saying I was owed Â£13 for my services being terminated in late March, since I did pay for the full month right at the start. I raised a complaint and they kindly offered me Â£50 in a goodwill sorta thing for my troubles. This was confirmed in an email on 16/04/2021. Fast forward to 10th May. I had still not received my Credit. Not only that, I was sent a letter that I owe Virgin Â£30ish. Well 5 calls on the 10th, lasting a combined 4 hour 22 minutes consisting of a few disconnections (one disconnection happening 3 hours into a call) I find out that Virgin never cancelled on the 27th March. They were still trying to charge me. And the Credit I was promised was used to reduce these charges on my bills I never received. This has took out some of my credit score success since it appears Iâve been missing some payments I had no idea about. During my 4 Hour 22 Minute worth of calls, I do speak to a lot of customer service reps. Two of which are very helpful. They explain to me why I havenât had my credit, that Iâm still with Virgin apparently. They set me up to have my account cancelled (again) the following day. They tell me they will âremoveâ the charges between the 27th March and 11th May. And I may see my credit on my final bill. So I was expecting a final bill of Â£63 Credit, the Â£50 from good will and the Â£13 owed from March. Nope on 12/05/2021 they still want Â£9 off of me? Despite getting letters of credit from them and myself and the customer reps agreeing that I was mistakenly still with Virgin Media after the 27th? So what are they charging me for? All in all, this is the worst product Iâve paid for. The amount it has cost me in time and effort, when originally this all started just because I told them I was moving and would like to move my services. Itâs ended up in me losing out on Credit Score, Time, Data and Money. Virgin lost a customer who was wanting to stick with them despite some drops in speed, because after all their prices are very good. No oneâs won. My ordeal continues to this day trying to not be charged and trying to get my credit although Iâm less bothered by the Credit at this point.

567,"Donât often leave reviews but I was so shocked in the end by Virginâs customer service that I felt obliged to share my experience here. Couple of things happened, firstly on basics: 1) They are a classic âwait for hours on the phone, finally get through to someone, get put on hold, then get disconnectedâ service and they do NOT bother calling you back. Takes 3-4 attempts to see a basic conversation through2) They DONâT take notes about your calls unless it suits them - so when you call back weeks or months later referring to advice given in a past conversation it very likely wonât have been recorded - the result of which means they will feign ignorance and change advice as it suits them3) Finally upon joining Virgin I was given advice about options that were open to me should I need to cancel my contract early. One of these were the option of transferring to a new owner, which would have meant I would avoid paying early disconnection charges. I spent months setting this up under very specific directions from virgin, only to get to the final day where they then said they didnât support this type of transaction at all (despite earlier detailed guidance from them)4) Finally they donât actually process complaints. They literally file the and close them on the spot (and told me this).  In short, surprisingly horrendous customer service, conflicting advice, poor standards of care including note taking or call backs, and in the end they will do what they please without listening to the customer.

He gave me options of the packages and told me the most suitable one for me which I agreed with. He also stated he would take care of my transition from my previous provider and that I would not need to contact them or pay any cancellations fees. He said to contact him  directly from 9am to 8pm and gave his cell number to me.. A month later not only do I notice he set me up on the wrong package but he had not dealt with my previous provider so I had been slapped with a huge cancellation fee and had to liaise with them for an hour to cancel my contract at no extra cost. I had tried to contact contact Chris during this period numerous times via call and text for more then a week and no response to date. Once I set up the Virgin WiFi which I received on the 17th of April, I had no network. I contacted Virgin on the 21st of April as there was still no network and they said there was a power outage in the Ha1 region and that it would be working by 3pm that day. Mind you the outage had apparently occurred since the 12th of April. Whilst speaking to the person who told me about the outage, I told her to update my package and she said she would connect me to the relevant department but the line got disconnected. There was no call back either so I tried to call the customer service again through their number on the website to update the package and was put on hold for half an hour at which point I got frustrated and hung up. When I called today 23rd April, I got an update stating the service is still down and expected to be fixed by the 26th of April. Seriously like how long does this take?!

This is a stark contrast to other providers who advertise a maximum speed but rarely reach even close to those speeds. I had never had an issue with customer service and their website handled most of what I needed in terms of getting info or changes to my account. BT, for example, has an awful website, badly designed, slow and limited in its functionality. The router provided was also above standard for the industry as it was much more reliable than others on the market and with faster peak speeds. Overall I have no reason to give them less than 5 stars.",2.0
620,"I got a contract for 18months because the price was really good. But in the end, it seems to be more expensive. When I initially started the contract, I asked what would it happen if I cancel before the end on the 18months. They said I could move my services to the new flat or cancel paying a disconnection fee of maximum 50% of the current monies left.  Well, now that it is happening is another story. I have 6 months left. They cannot supply internet where I go (Brighton, odd). And basically they are saying: one month needs to be paid to have the services on until I leave which is understandable. That is Â£23.95. But the following 5 months the disconnection fee is Â£106.38, which is Â£21.27 per month!! Nearly the same I am paying to have the service! On top of that. It is impossible to speak to an agent on the phone. Every time I want to speak to an agent I need to spend 15-20min chatting to a machine, and then depending o the issue an agent would appear, which replies every several minutes. I never receive clear information, so confusing. I have spent literally 1 hours chatting to cancel my services. And I still need to send the router to them to avoid a fine.  Summary.

I have called them today and been told that the complaint is still open and somehow they can not see the deal they offered had been accepted therefore they can not honour the deal. If you can't see any deal achieved why would you keep a complaint open and keep charging a higher amount? Totally unprofessional and unreliable . Stay away !",1.0

624,ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!! Non-existent customer service. One of the hardest companies to leave. Website for complaints is often down. Phoning through for complaints or fixing an issue led to me being hung up on 5 times after waiting over an hour to be connected each time. Virgin would not know competency if it was slap in the face with it. Absolutely tired of this ****** company.,2.0
625,"TLDR; Avoid this company at all costs!If you're unfortunate to be with Virgin already and have technical problems, call 08000527553 to skip the customer service waiting queue nightmare to go to the second line technical team directly (they answer in less than a minute). My personal experienceI've been plagued with issues with their internet since October 2020, and have literally spent 20+ hours, in the month of February alone, over the phone with them to try and explain my problems. We're now in March, I still don't have internet working properly and I can't wait for my contract to expire to move to another provider. Horrendous customer serviceThe customer service is a complete mess: getting someone over the phone is a lot more difficult than it should, probably to deter clients from calling. When I want to speak with someone, I often end up with an automated voice sending me a link on my mobile to ""troubleshoot my broadband connection issue"". Technical nightmareWhen you finally manage to have someone over the line, they force you to go through meaningless troubleshooting (""turn off and on your router"") even though the issue is unrelated, because they do not have the proper technical knowledge (I have a signal SNR issue where the connection is up and down, disconnecting multiple times per day). They've sent a different engineer 5 times at my property: 2 times my isolator was replaced (and nothing else) and 2 times the engineers said the issue was with the network team, not them (one even refused to get out of his car claiming he didn't bring any face mask and only discussed by phone). At some point, I managed to get the second line technical team phone number (08000527553) and avoided discussing with the technical team (150 or 03454541111), which saved time as they only kept asking me to reboot my router to make it work.When the issue is finally raised to the proper team, don't think this will solve anything: this team has closed my fault ticket 7 times (!!) between the 26 January and the 4 March wrongly claiming my problem was fixed, and everytime I had to go through the hassle of re-explaining my issue (when I managed to have someone over the phone) and opening a new fault ticket. Lack of any type of compensation/alternative solutionAlso, be warned that Virgin has a policy to only give you some credit back if you have a total loss of service for more than 72 hours. If you manage to be connected only one hour per day during this period, they will not compensate you in any form: the customer service department tells you their hands are tied and that you need to ask the technical team to raise a compensation request, but the technical team tells you they have no control over the compensation claims anyway because it's an automatic process. I have been using my 3G data non-stop since the 27th of February (we're the 11th of March and it's still not working) to work from home, but my claims are denied (because apparently there may have been internet an hour or so here and here). If like me, you don't have internet at all, don't even bother asking Virgin for some alternative solution (mobile broadband, mobile phone 4G credit, etc...) as they cannot (or won't) help you in any way. Complains are ignoredI've raised several complains but the compliance department doesn't even bother calling you back (even though I'm told they will call back within 5 days over the phone). ""Escalating"" the issue doesn't even make a difference, expect that someone tells you the compliance department will call you back within 48 hours (but they don't).",1.0

Virgin Medea decided that they don't need to pay compensation because they say that  was intermittent lost of internet and would not believe us when we say that it was constant. Its their word against ours. Wait, it gets even better. No we are in March and so far we had 8 consecutive days and counting without internet.

Finally, I sent a letter to their complaints department in Sunderland, citing my complaint, the original reference number, and copies of all correspondence. Royal Mail obtained a signature but still according to Virgin Media I didnât get back in touch! Even yesterday trying once again to resolve this on the phone I spoke to the resolution team who decided to pass me back through to Virgin Mobile an overseas call centre where the staff sound like robots and have absolutely no idea about customer service! So, thanks Virgin Media and thanks to your outbound retention team based in sunny Birmingham for mis-selling. Please donât respond asking me to text you, I think I have made adequate attempts to resolve this and you have failed. As for closing my complaint I have escalated it now to CISAS and the Financial Ombudsman, next stop the ICO for the fact your employee stole my bank details from my Virgin Media account and set up a direct debit with my bank for Virgin Mobile, I misuse of my personal data.

The customer service is absolutely terrible, we have been on around 13 different calls, each with 1 hour wait times and we get bounced back and forth between departments who tell us the same thing over and over. We ordered wifi boosters with 3 DIFFERENT customer service agents. THREE! After the 2 weeks they all said to wait, we didn't receive anything and called up again only to be told no one had ordered anything for us and nothing was on the system even when we registered the boosters to be delivered online ourselves as well.

One time our wifi cut out for 4 days, which was shocking in itself and we had 5 people working and learning from home and Virgin said they canât do anything to fix it. All they said was wait for an engineer to come, when the nearest available appointment was a week later.

I was in a zoom meeting and my son was doing his home learning. We were both kicked out and the wifi disappeared from the list of available networks. I immediately tried to contact Virgin on 150 but was on hold for almost an hour after hearing a less than helpful automated message. I eventually got to speak to someone who asked me to unplug my router and plug it back in again after a few minutes. Didn't work. Tried to call back and couldn't get through. The Network eventually appeared in the list but i couldn't access any web addresses or log into my company's VPN. I've been without internet since and was told the ""estimated"" date and time of completion would be 28th January at 10:20am. I had internet from 8am that morning but 2 hours later, the internet had disappeared again. I've contacted customer services again and asked to leave, if the service i'm paying for isn't fixed by the end of the day. I was informed by the leavers team that the fix in the whole of my area will now be fixed by 3rd February. Unacceptable. Customers are working from home and home schooling their children. Any fix should be resolved as quickly as possible and we should be informed of any issues, rather than us having to spend most of our day on the phone to be told nothing useful. I received a letter a few weeks ago stating that my plan was increasing. If my service was faultless, i'd have no problem paying more for my plan.",2.0
676,Customer service if you have a problem or every 6 months when they put your bill up is dreadful. You will be spending hours of your life on hold. Worst customer service of any of the providers I've been with.,1.0
677,"there is an obvious problem with my broadband and TV package which Virgin, after several conversations with them, are not prepared to resolve.  They claim out of this world broadband speeds but in reality I find them quite slow for what I pay for the service (almost Â£60)",2.0
678,"Virgin Media customer service are non-existent. I spent over 10 hours across three days trying to contact customer service; their customer service line puts one on hold for 60+ minutes, and then disconnects if one has not yet reached an agent (which rarely occurs). When one does finally reach an agent, s/he has no authority to resolve problems; they only transfer to other agents. Agents then refuse to admit problems, and instead threaten customers with legal action for breach of contract when they assert that Virgin Media's services do not work as advertised. Prices change without notice, and customer service agents deny that there is any change even when presented with differing bills for the same service. Reaching any customer service agent at all required 19(!) posts on Virgin Media's Facebook page, in order to finally arrange a Webchat. Virgin Media are dishonest thieves whose have systems designed to waste so much customer time that the customer gives up and pays whatever they ask. One * for customer service is too much. AVOID.",2.0
679,"I'm simply disgusted with the service. Before I had the 50mbps fibre but I was only getting about 8-9mbps and then I had to pay more to upgrade to the 10mbps package. They did nothing attheor end to try fix my service. Their get out jail card is based on you getting 'UP TO' 50mbps. Luckliy by street fibre optics were recently upgraded by the council so I do get more speed now. However, my router needs to be reset 2-3 times a day. I frequently lose connect and have to reboot the router. I have tried to contact Virgin, but it is virtually impossible. DO NOT SWITCH TO VIRGIN.",2.0
680,"Virgin media is not fit for purpose.  Broadband speed good when hard wired but wireless is intermittent.  Customer service is non existent. TV service is a joke. The problems are endless and too may to go into here. We had an Engineers visit last year when the system was working, albeit intermittently. but when he left we had no service of anything for 8 days. The next engineer to visit said the first had damaged it. Told we would be compensated in June 2020. Still waiting.  We were updated to 360 in December 2020. Nothing works consistently. Engineer visiting tomorrow but will be the last visit they make other than collecting their equipment when I go back to Sky.  If your'e thinking of going to Virgin Media, DON'T, you will regret it.",1.0
681,"I have been with virgin for a couple of years, goes without saying that I have been having problems with them from day one. After several visits from the engineers, it was ascertained that the problem was in the junction box, instead to add new connections they have patched everyone to the existing one not allowing enough speed to go through to all, hence the connection and the speeds keep dropping. Apparently, they know this as several neighbours have made a complaint but, instead of fixing the problem, they keep sending people out to see the internal connections which we know there are not the problem. The customer service team is horrendous, and when you want to raise a complaint and you ask what exactly is the engineer coming out to fix again, the supervisors hang up on you, very professional",2.0
682,No customer support for technical faults. Facing lot of intermittent connections from 1.5 months. Raised a compliant 2 times no response from these people. I do not suggest to go with these people. Very unresponsive. For virgin ref: compliant numbers are: C-1101213210 and C-150121924.,2.0
683,Virgin Media have not kept their word with anything. Customer service is zero. Terrible. I was promised compensation for no TV or broadband for 6 days. They basically told me Tough! I eventually got Â£7 credit to my account. The fibre broadband keeps dropping out or just no service. Be careful when you sign up. They are very helpful at the start. then it all goes downhill! Now they want to put price up by Â£3.50 Absolutely disgraceful,2.0
684,"Cancellation nightmare - after seeing great offer for VM broadband i decided to switch, then it began! Hub received promptly (best part of the service) but couldnt get it connected so started the tedious time waste of trying to get to talk to anyone over phone or their cs text service for 2 days,who might help.  Next day determined to now cancel this altogether finally got someone after over hours wait and politely asked them to cancel, but guy on phone obviously drilled on trying to keep you, i said over and over again that i had changed my mind and just want to return hub but he waant having any of it, and after confirming my details the call went dead.. i presumed this had been cancelled but then started getting emails and texts welcoming me to VM and and comfirming i am now connected! I replied to every message saying i am not commected and have canceÄºled the switch but this has just continued for a week with my texting and leaving messages to them saying i am not with VM and have cancelled. But, when approaching another provider have been told cannot switch to them as am with VM and they have to  cancel something on their system before i can go elsewhere.  More phone caÄºls not answered. Only 1 of their cs text team seemed to have any idea what was happening but umfortumately told me she was unable to resolve it...but did say my accoumt at that time had not been canceÄºled and was active.  To cut a long story short i have stayed with my current provided who have now offered me a great deal and having explained the issues i hipe have managed to cancel everything, but incase they havnt (as not yet have had any comfirmatiom of cancellatiom from VM) i have made sure no money can be taken by them from my account.",2.0
685,"CROOKS!!AVOID! Broadband speeds and reliability are ok, but if you decide to cancel their service after your contract with them expires is a complete nightmare. First, once you select ""If you are thinking of leaving us"" option on the phone, they put you on a queue, I've waited for up to an hour on occasions and the line randomly hangs up while you are in the queue. If you are lucky enough to get to a customer service representative, they'll try and give you a crap new deal, if you refuse, they'll ""transfer"" you to a colleague and then the big old wait is on and it will randomly hang up again. I've wasted 3 days trying to cancel my service with Virgin and still haven't...Oh, and once they kick you out of the waiting queue, you can't call again for a few hours, they put you in a ban list or something, complete CROOKS!!",2.0
686,"The Virgin internet fibre/cable speeds in Guildford are appalling with 60Mbps max download speed (200 advertised by Virgin) and we get frequent outages. Virgin hiked the cost of their cheapest available phone/TV/internet bundle to Â£74 in a renewed contract in Jan 2021 previously Â£55. My partner gave up a complaining phone call after 70 minutes and used their website complaint system instead but has not had any reply weeks later . Today (21/01/2021) we got a Virgin letter saying the cost is going up by Â£4.00 from March , but we still don't know what we are actually paying yet until the first bill comes in. Is there a true fibreoptic broadband provider in the UK?  Can anyone recommend a better internet provider? What are individual experiences of changing from Virgin to another provider?",2.0
687,"DON'T BE TEMPTED BY THE INITIAL OFFER!I have been with Virgin Media for around 7 years at 3 different properties. When I moved from my 1st to 2nd property I had no issues and the transfer was smooth but it all went down hill from there with them trying to hike prices at least twice a year mid contract. Every time I had to phone to contest taking 2 or 3 phone calls of anything up to an hour. When me and my partner separated I could not move my account with me and had to set up a new one at my new address. Virgin messed up all the passwords so I could not access either account for nearly 3 weeks with multiple phone calls. Had to do a transfer of contract responsibility to my ex so she could take over the bill but they couldn't even get that right after 5 attempts via phone and post. Got that frustrated I just cancelled the account and she had to open a new one in her name. Messed up my passwords and email again and they tried to close both accounts saying that I owed them and early exit fee. Once I got all of this sorted towards the end of my contract an offer came up online on my personal account where I could add the TV and faster broadband to my package for a total of Â£37 a month. Should have known better than to try and upgrade!Received email confirmation of price and package details direct from Virgin Media and my new TiVo box arrived later that week. Set it all up and within a week got my first bill which was over Â£22 more a month than quoted. Here we go again! 42 minute phone call with no result and the promise of a call back from a manager the next day. No call back. Another 47 minute call where I emailed the proof of the price while they were still on the line to the email address they were spelling out for me, only to be told they couldn't access that email and a manager would call me back in 24 hours. Nobody called me back. Another 75 minute phone call speaking to 4 different people and they finally reduced it to.......Â£37.50 and I was told this was the closest they could get the package. These phone calls were the ones when I actually spoke to somebody after multiple times of being on hold for 20 to 30 minutes and then them hanging up.After taking a tv package I realised how little there was to watch on Virgin as you have to pay for the larger bundles if you want any of the sky channels and a large percentage of what is available on Freeview for nothing. This contract ended on the 28th of December so Virgin decided they now want to charge me Â£59 a month for the privilege of rubbish tv, a landline I have never used and averagely performing broadband. A few days later an email also informs me they are putting their prices up a further Â£3.50 as well! I phoned them thinking I will be able to haggle and get a cheap deal as usual but not this time. The cheapest they would do broadband on its own was Â£37 while new customers were getting it at Â£28 so I have cancelled finally. Oh and if you are late paying your bill they will phone you 2 or 3 times a day without fail until its paid but you cant contact them most of the time if you have a problem.If you have got to the bottom of this review I strongly urge you not to give Virgin Media your custom as they are rip off merchants of the highest order and their customer service is non-existent.",2.0

I pay Â£50 a month for this and they have just told me they are increasing the price by Â£3.50. They should be refunding for the speeds I am paying for and never getting. I only stay with them because other suppliers do not have fibre in my area and offer only 10 mbps download speeds. As soon as they do offer fibre, I am leaving. It is disgraceful they are allowed to falsely claim you can expect those download speeds. The truth is you will get no where near them. Absolute con.

692,"absolute joke, after waiting for almost an hour I get through, I complain about the recent email announcing that an increase is on the way (Â£3.50)..my package consisted of  just TV landline and Broadband  and i was paying around the Â£50 per month mark.The woman at the end of the phone up helled the price rise stating that VM was due to put the price up last year but due to the covid 19 they  held back (how saintly) i raised the point that what the difference now from then ie we still have covid and are in full lockdown and in a worse place financially than last year.She replied that its because of the govmt they tell VM to increase the price, (thinking i must sound stupid on the phone )I said that the Gvmt would NEVER tell a company to increase their prices and enlightened her about free enterprise and how the Gvmt actually encourage competition that's why you have the monopolies commission etc, she then said 'its the VAT ..the tax when they put it up'thats what it is (there is a bit of Dunning- Krugar syndrome going on with this woman )I said tax/ VAT are at 20 per cent ,they haven't been changed and if they do it will be announced in April normally , not March ,unless you are psychic. I ask for a cheaper price  , she trys to give me a slight discount but its a sneeky one as it wont last as long as the whole contract , just 6 months , I ask to take away the TV cha that i don't watch and the landline that i don't use , she says her screen has grayed out on that box , she cant help me , but will transfer me to someone else .half hour later i speak to an asian man who takes me through all the sec procedures again , i tell him my problem i he starts to speak fast and on hands free i can only make out the odd word, another transfer, another wait, another taken through security, i say b4 i talk do u have the authority to do what i ask , he says what is it , i tell him give me a price without tv and phone , he quotes me Â£40. i said is that for 100 mps he said yes , i then asked for 60mps  he quoted Â£34 permonth , i said looking at that its dear to other companies, I said i give you 1months notice ..after looking around  and being 60 and all the different routers and cables become confusing so i bottled out. I ring up VM again to reverse the cancellation, i get through after 30 mins to a young asian woman who asked me my name  , address and postcode , i had to spell out my name  then she asks postcode  and house number and turns round and says that my name does not match up with that address, so we go through the landline tel number and i get put on hold for 10 mins, she comes back and says how can i help , i say do you have my details now on screen she says yes  and then we go through security procedure ...again!..i tell her my story and ask her what s the best deal for the old package  i had but with slower Broadband , she says she cant downgrade  any package and puts me through to another agent , 30 mins later i speak to another agent and i say to her is she the right person to do the biz, so i don't waste time , she says she is and i ask her to look at my bundle and if she can do anything as i might reconsider leaving(at this point I'm scheduled for termination 8th feb)she says she can bring it down a little more , and after that being squeezed out of her i then asked for the price if my speed was reduced to 60 mps, she relied (wait for it!!) that due to how the bundles are packaged ,it will be more expensive ????. i said then by your reckoning and logic if i upgrade my package one by adding things on , my monthly payments should reduced, is that correct i asked? she replied i know what your implying and how it sounds ,but it just is ,..I think its a wall to keep the price high. i asked is that the very best she could  do and she said yes , so i said okay we will roll with that....i then hang up the landline phone from her and as i do my mobile rang, i then here the dulcet tones of a mature peoples person old school saleman on the mobile , telling me how sorry  VM that I'm leaving , he tell s me I'm a VIP and the length of time i v been with them how wud i like to have my TV channels ..+ 2 others thrown in , your landline ...and 100 mps broadband for just Â£29 per month.. isaid yes please , i asked about his authority  and he informed me that he is higher up the ladder then Cust Serv by quite a few rungs , so i  say so therefore you have the ability to overule any decision by cust serv and any deal they make you can trump it,,is that correct ? he assures me , i said okay that's fine send me an email with the new revised contract...so the next day i get an email from VM and its the contract for Â£44.30 permonth not Â£29.00.. so because he used a VM  mobile i sent a message to him saying i haven't seen your email yet is everything ok, i didn't get an answer..most likely wont do. but i cant pay Â£44 to them  now after having a deal for Â£29... so i will have to cancel the contract again and do it in writing to head office .. recorded del!!(not falling for that one ) as i have 14 days cool off period. in the letter  i mention my disappointment on not honouring the deal the offered me ..anyway if i don't hear from them  then i have to let things take their  course and find i new provider",2.0

709,"Virgin Review Virgin media - possibly the single worst internet provider I have ever dealt with. Apologies, this is a long review, but I beg you read it. They installed fibre optic into our building, promised tenants superior service enticing a bunch of us to move away from our slower, but stable providers.  After 2 months of problems, 17 customer service calls, and 5 engineers coming to the building, I've had enough.  1) First, when they surveyed the building they failed to check the building wires properly. Whilst it is a new build, every apartment in the building is fitting with air filled cables. Apparently these are not fit for use with Virgin media equipment (I am not an electrician/network specialist - I am repeating what the last Virgin media senior engineer told me). For me this hasn't been a problem, testing the cable shows a good connection but for others in the building it has meant they've switched to Virgin and they are completely unable to connect (air filled cable twisted and shorting out the circuit).  Had they of properly surveyed the building, they would have realised this. 2) Secondly, whilst my connection is fine I was still running into significant downtime. The 4th engineer that came to the property reviewed the fibre centre in the risers of the building to discover that the Virgin Installation team had failed to plug the connections in properly. Meaning that whilst I had a connection, it was only to 1 out of the 4 available network centres. When that centre went down, the building was unable to fail over to any of the other 3 available.  Amazing. Couldn't make this incompetence up. 3) Even now when I am connected to all 4 network centres, Virgin has CONSTANT network issues. I have been without a stable connection for the whole of the Christmas period. I am writing this whilst hot-spotting from my mobile.  4) When I am actually connected to the internet I am on the 200Mbps package with a guaranteed minimum of around 100Mbps - I'd be so lucky. In the 2 months i've been with these jokes, I have at the most 80Mbps but recently its been more like 20-30mbps. Whilst this is plenty for most people, my use case is somewhat unique, especially whilst working from home. My point is, don't bother paying a premium for Virgin thinking you'll get crazy speeds. You won't. .. Don't worry. My complaints don't stop here. 5) I have called approximately 17 times since November 7th to explain the issues. Every time you call, don't expect to be on hold for anything less than 40 minutes before getting to speak with an agent. Certainly don't expect a resolution. After the 10th time I requested to speak with a manager. I've never once been put straight through - its always ""we promise a call back"". NOPE. I have been promised a call back by a manager 5 times and only on ONE occasion has that actually happened. 6) I have asked them for an interim fix for whilst they try fix the network issues (of course, they are unable to tell me what the network issue is). I have suggested a WiFi dongle for when the service is down. NOPE.  7) I've been charged Â£70 for the privilege of dealing with these clowns so far. Their customer service agents don't care about your issue. They don't want to help or find a resolution. They can't tell you what the issues are.  I made the mistake of not looking on here before I went with Virgin. I cannot convey strongly enough how diabolical they are. I am currently collecting evidence to provide to the Ombudsman, speaking with the building management (that manage all the apartments blocks in my area - Paddington) to get Virgin removed from the building and prevent them from falsely advertising their services in all their buildings, and I am speaking with a friend at Hyper Optic hoping he will be able to help get them installed instead.",2.0

Only when you complain do they acknowledge ""known issues"" in your area (May-July and Sept 2020 onwards with the ""fix"" not expected until Feb 2021!!). Throughout these periods the online issues tool stated that there were no issues - useless and outright misleading. In Sept 2020 I naively upgraded from 100Mb (usually getting c90Mbs) to 200Mb, yet only saw speeds of over 100Mb on the single day that the upgrade happened. Thereafter, the speeds were actually worse and the downtimes increased. The online community of experts tries to help but have no real power to do so. And, of course, they try very hard to avoid actually speaking to you.",1.0

713,"A summary of the issues Iâve had with Virgin Media.  I am leaving this review to warn people of the issues I have had, but also in the hope that someone from Virgin will give me some actual explanation for why these issues are happening and when they might be fixed. I still hope to one day get the fast, reliable connection for which I am paying.  - Extremely unreliable connection. During certain periods, my internet will simply temporarily stop working briefly and then reconnect again. This can go on for anything between a day and a week. The issue has been occurring irregularly for over 2 years and Virgin have offered absolutely no reason as to why, despite asking on numerous occasions. I am told there are âintermittent connection issues in your areaâ with no further info. - When searching for faults in my area, the website always shows no faults. However, when phoning (after countless messages urging me to use the website instead), a message does admit thereâs a fault... with no ETA on resolution or explanation of what is happening. - When paying a bill online, sometimes after entering card details etc, the form will tell me that âsomething went wrong, please try again laterâ. On trying again, the same message will appear. On checking my bank statement, I find that I have been charged for BOTH of these supposedly failed transactions, each for over Â£100. - When trying to get a refund for the above, clearly a result of Virginâs defective website, we are told no, âVirgin Media does not give refundsâ using the online chat customer service function. When phoning the next day, a very helpful employee said that yes, I can absolutely have a refund. Why the inconsistency? If I had accepted the first answer, I would be down over Â£100 because of Virginâs incompetence or downright dishonesty. - 10 days later, the bill is still showing as unpaid. - You simply canât log in to the website on certain browsers. On chime, the sign in form just doesnât work. The sign in button does nothing. - The website forces stupidly restrictive password rules, with a maximum length and limit on certain special characters, which actually WEAKEN passwords as well as make my usual variable password convention unusable.- Working from home during the pandemic has often been impossible thanks to connection unreliability. - I live-stream and Virgin is the only high-speed connection in my area, but during common random periods of unreliability, the very expensive internet package I have selected is absolutely useless and a total waste of a very significant bill relative to my income. - It is now Christmas and instead of meeting friends and family I have decided to live-stream with friends in order to adhere to COVID quarantine rules. Of course, now is one of the all too common days of non functional internet. - I donât really ever ask/expect/fish for refunds, but considering the atrocious product and service I am paying for, it is disappointing that Virgin have never once offered any compensation for any of the faults I have experienced.",1.0

744,"I would welcome anyone's views on the grievances outlined in a letter of complaint I sent off by email today. I have now noticed that since sending the letter off, the speed has considerably dropped.  It might be worth mentioning also my yearly contract had finished back in September. I had only been paying 29 sterling as a special promotion for 100mbps when I initially signed up.  By telephone, I attempted to renew the contract and at first I was offered the same packet but for 59 sterling.  I refused to accept it and hung up. But didn't give up and rang again.  But I didn't give up.  By some sort of fluke I managed to get through to Marianne at Customer Retention.  She offered me something completely different for 28 sterling but the same packet for the same speed.  I asked her how so, since I was originally quoted a different price.  She said, in future, just ask to be put through to Customer Retention.  What is this?  There is no option for Customer Retention when you make a call.  Press 1,2,3, 4 for limited options no mention of Customer Retention.  After reading all the reviews of people in similar circumstances, I thought it was worth a mention.  Only after reading other reviews of people being encouraged to accept the initial quote did it ring a bell.  Getting back to my grievances over the last 2 days, here is the letter:- Please note that my reference to being a 'satisfied customer' was in regards to the high speed only.  This was why I signed up in the first place.     TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,  I have been a customer with Virgin media since October 2019 and in that time, I have been more than satisfied with the quality of services provided.  A situation has now arisen in the past two days that requires me to move to another home.  Consequently, I decided to act right away in an attempt to transfer my account to the new address. The address was in the same town, not far from the present address.  By doÄ±ng this, I had no inclination Ä±t would turn out to be a problem lÄ±ke the one that unfolded. Yesterday, I went online to check if your services were available at the new address. I entered the postcode several times on the facility provided via my online account. However, there was an instruction 'please wait' each time I entered. I assumed that maybe this was because there were lots of apartments in the building. Subsequently, I proceeded to enter the online chat facility under 'moving home' to get further clarification on the issue. From the outset of the chat, I specifically outlined the nature of my enquiry ie I would be moving home and I wanted to find out if Virgin Media was available in that area:  and, that my previous attempts to enter the postcode had been unsuccessful. This was not clarified immediately by the agent but instead, he proceeded to ask for security details and lots of information relating to the new address. He also asked if I wanted Virgin Media at the new address to which I replied 'I did'.  Since this turned out to be a lengthy procedure, I interpreted it as meaning that the service was indeed available at the new address;  after all I had not been advised otherwise. Or, indeed my interpretation was that I needed to go through this procedure just to find out if services were, in fact available in the area. The correspondence ended with the agent advising me that another agent would be in touch in the next 45 minutes. In the meantime, I decided to call Virgin Media for further clarification.  I explained what had happened as outlined above.  The agent advised that it was an unnecessary procedure and there should have been a check beforehand to establish if the service was available at said location. He then kindly proceeded to check this out and was able to confirm that it wasn't in fact, available. He also advised there would be a fee for disconnection. I was disappointed when I heard this and the agent was sympathetic to my concerns.  He was very helpful and kindly offered to transfer me to customer care which I accepted. I waited for 20 minutes but there was no reply. Despite this, I continued to the chat facility in the hope that maybe there would be some other options available.  Before I could get to explain what had happened, the agent took me through the whole process again asking for lots of information. In between times, I asked if he could see the messages from the first point of contact where I had already given all the same information.  As time went on, I became increasingly frustrated and the conversation was just one of disarray and confusion. At the end of it, he said the service was indeed not available and that there would be a fee for disconnection.  Then he encouraged me to book a cancellation date. My account of the correspondence, leads me to my poÄ±nt in writing to you.  My grievance is twofold: 1    I can only describe yesterday's communication as a mission impossible.  For at least four hours, I was trying to clarify something that could have been clarified at the outset.  In addition, there was no consistency in the means of communication, at least not what one would expect from a high profile service provider.  It provided nothing but unnecessary confusion for such a simple inquiry.  Of course with exception to the agent's help via telephone call. My hope is that in highlighting the matter, you may take it on board and review it for whatever purposes. 2   The above, coupled with the fact that I was alarmed to learn that I would have to pay a disconnection fee.  This, I find totally incomprehensible.  Taking into consideration the fact that I did not wish to leave Virgin Media  in the first place and that your broadband service was not available for that location. It was not a matter of me being dissatisfied with your services.  Why, therefore should I be penalised for something that is totally out of my control? When I renewed my contract back in September, I could not foresee that I would be moving home in the future. It came about out of necessity. Just like I could not foresee the service would not be available at the new address.  The terms of the contract do not allow for such a predicament.  In other words, when I agreed to that contract, I did so, because I was happy with the service after one year's subscription. I never perceived that I would leave it, no matter what the circumstances. I could understand it would be different if It had been a situation whereby I had chosen to leave the service as a dissatisfied customer.  Indeed, I would accept, via the terms of the contract, I was liable to pay a disconnection fee.  This however is not the case. Furthermore, I am a single parent who is really struggling to make ends meet under the benefits system at this period of time.  The internet connection is a valuable lifeline for me and my child. In that respect, no matter how a little money I receive every month, I have always made it a priority when it comes to paying the essential bills. Thereby a loyal customer.  I would also add that even if I was of affluent status, the principle of the matter outlined above would still remain the same. Now, I find myself in a situation whereby I must move to another home which incurs further costs.  Perhaps you can understand, that such a fee on top of that, I would struggle to pay; and simply have not got the funds to do so. In light of these circumstances and for the reasons aforementioned, I would appeal to you to consider a waiver of the penalty fee. Trusting you will acknowledge. I am enclosing a record of yesterday's correspondence for reference.  So the above letter outlined my grievances.  I again decided to contact them out of sheer frustration, not wanting to let it go  This time, (after waiting 30 minutes for a response and paying for the call) I asked what the options where. This individual advised that when I pay the diconnection fee and hook up with another provider, that provider will cover the cost of the fee as part of their payment plan.  Now, I ask all of you out there.  Have you ever heard anything the likes of?????  He's on the other side of a phone call and he thinks I was born yesterday!!!! Honestly as we say too good to be true.  Wish it were that simple! I then asked if there was any way of airing the complaint since the address I sent the mail off to was the only address I could find (after much deliberation on Google Search).  There was no facility on their online system for making a complaint.  He further advised me to make the issues known on twitter and facebook.  Really, can I trust this? Really folks, should customer care not be of utmost priority?  They are Virgin Media and invincible because of their good reviews for high speeds.  Was that not a ploy to get the customers in the initial stages.  Why have so many perople mentioned that speeds have been reduced.  How can the customer have faith?

Speaking with the team at virgin they say to ""empty your downloads"" - We had no downloads - and then they would check there is no faults, according the virgin there never was a fault so they wouldn't help. When our wifi occasionally started to drop out we where told very similar things ""there's no fault"" ""It must be your device"" etc, well funny that 8 different devices can throw up the exact same issue. Upon our contract coming to the end of the first year we got offered a renewal price of over Â£60 for a service we paid under Â£30 for! I called and asked for their best price and they said Â£58 was the absolute best. I got the exact same package at talktalk for Â£25 so called back to cancel and all of a sudden they offered us the exact same package for Â£28. If that was offered at first then MAYBE I would have considered it but having spent hours waiting on hold to be told an entire bunch of different rubbish by virgin media I decided enough was enough. After cancelling Virgin I was still stuck with them for 30 days, during this period my wifi speed dropped from 100mbps down to between 10 and 20 mbps. I'm glad I'm no longer with this money hungry service.- Over 1 hour wait times outside of covid-19- Almost 2 hour wait time inside of covid-19- Webchat for support is incredibly glitchy, you get refreshed out, the wait time displays as 1 second even though you'll wait over an hour.- Service is slowed after cancelling- Random additional charges of Â£1 - Â£5 added to your bills with no explanation.- Try at every cost to con you into paying above the odds- Online portal doesn't work for half the pages, you cannot look at prices, update details etc. Honestly terrible company.",1.0

I received an email from Virgin Media asking me to call a number ""as some of the information required was missing"".  I called the number ; BIG MISTAKE !What followed was 30 minutes of high pressure sales during which ;1. The phone connection went down three times, and I was called back.2. I could barely understand what the caller was saying.3. The caller asked for the first, third and fifth character in my password ..... I thought only I was supposed to know my password.... obvious security implications for my account.4. I was coerced into 350 Mb/s internet, which I can't afford, and which has a contract length of 18months versus 1 month for 200Mb/s.5. I was coerced into opening a Virgin Mobile account, which I don't want, and which included the caller asking me for an account password, security implications AGAIN.6. When I was asked for bank details, which Virgin Media already have, as I pay by direct debit, I ""smelled a rat"". I told the caller I wanted my account reverting back to the way it was after which the caller still insisted I carry on with the process. I told the caller I was going to hang up the phone now, and my account should be reverted back to normal, and I hung up.7. Less than 1 minute later, the caller rang again and before they could say anything, I told them that our dealings were finished and I wanted my account reverting back to the way it was, and hung up. The initial email I was sent asking me to call them was misleading, and dishonest ; it used the excuse of needing information to subject me to a sales call ; had they said, honestly, that it was a sales call, I wouldn't have bothered. So here I ; still haven't got 200Mb/s internet, wasted 30 minutes of my life trying to understand a phone caller, and Virgin Media don't want to communicate with me about my email to them......

VM started adding late payment fees, threats of credit reference affected, court summons etcWe wrote to complain formally, VM replied assuring case escalated, someone will call to discuss, no phone callWe filed complain with CISAS, VM replied, claimed they called, but no answer, not true as no missed calls, VM request we text them, we did, several times, no repliesThen VM terminated our service, leaving us without phone or broadband in middle of CV19 pandemic unable for both of us to work from home!CISAS accepted our complain, gave VM 10 days to reply, VM did not even bothered to reply to CISAS until 11th day, a day after dateline, VM submitted their printouts of their system notes of my account where all important facts like my original email stating I'm applying for account transfer on same package and price per month, we're missing, instead VM's notes states; no record! VM subjected us to 3 months of hell, hoping their could bully us into paying their unwarranted demand, not realising we would stand firm against such malicious thieving corporates.We persevered, at extreme stress and cost having to tether our phone connection at higher mobile internet cost which are at best unreliable, prone to drop outs etc, but we would not allow VM to think they can bulky us.Never again, after this contract expires, will we EVER transact any VM services again ... Avoid or be at your own peril",2.0

807,"Absolutely awful.I've been having broadband and phone issues for quite some time, admittedly its intermittent. It might be fine for a month, then down for a week, then working again for a week, then down for a day. Phoned VirginMedia customer support numerous times, I've had a new router, been told its a area outage although nothing appears on the website. Eventually they sent an engineer who took about 10 minutes to discover there is a problem with the line running from the cabinet in the street to the house and it needs to be replaced, an engineer was booked and I didn't mind having to wait the 3 weeks.Day of the appointment arrives, no-one turns up. Service starts working again and I assume everything is fine.Then I get a text message confirming an engineer booking, I call Virgin to check whats going on and apparently someone did come but didn't want to bother me, the person they told to make sure I was in and asked to confirm if I had any COVID-19 sysmptoms, as they were only working outside. Anyway turns out they couldn't replace the cable so another team were sent, I don't know if this lot turned up but no-one let me know if they were here. They also couldn't replace the cable so a third team were sent, this one definitely did arrive because they knocked on the door and spoke to us. They replaced the cable and I was then getting full speed internet again... only they broke the phone service.Once again I had to call VirginMedia who didn't answer the phone, so I booked an engineer online, they came out and couldn't fix the issue, instead they had to send another engineer to port my phone over so, after about 10 days with no phone,  it is now connected to my SuperHub3 (which is not super at all, it may be the worst router I have ever used... and I've been a customer since the NTL days so I've had plenty of useless VirginMedia kit).In between all of this I have phoned and made complaints, they don't really care. First I asked for the automatic compensation, but apparently because the service was intermittent, you see sometimes my 362Mb service managed to achieve a 0.1Mb upload speed, so it wasn't completely broken. OK well what about the phone line that they broke, apparently the computer says NO, its an automatic thing and Ofcom a actually makes the decision, not VirginMedia and Ofcom says that them breaking it doesn't qualify as actually being broken. Absolute Rubbish!I'm not concerned with compensation, all I want is not to have to pay for a service that wasn't getting, I don't think that's unreasonable, but they won't offer me more that Â£20 after the 3 months of terrible service, lots of engineer visits and taking Â£150 in bills.

So with just 4 days left, I had to scramble to get Sky to keep my broadband up and til the 18th Septmeber, the new installation date.

We have discussed this extensively on Facebook.   When I managed to speak by telephone to someone at VM, I was told that they had identified a fault locally on 7 July which would involve intermittent (meaning there would be no financial compensation!) losses of signal until 24 July.  This sounds like quite a fault if it would take 17 days to address.  Apparently, others locally have spoken to VM by telephone and have received various possible explanations of the losses, indicating that the customer service people don't have a clue of what exactly is going on! A loss of service occurred again on 3 August, then again on 16, 17, 18 August.  It seems that there is now likely to be a regular series of such 'intermittent' faults.The same thing has happened twice already today. I have now written to VM Complaints in Sunderland three times, the first on 24 July.  None of my letters have been replied to! Not only is this a disturbingly regular loss of internet service from VM, especially when I rely on the service for external security camera recordings, telephone and Fire Stick TV reception, as well as general computer access to the internet, but their customer service is absolutely appalling. As VM are failing to respond to my written requests for information, I may be obliged to contact OFCOM for further advice. VM seem concerned more about boasting of their high speeds (100 Mbs here, but 50 Mbs would suit me), yet failing to supply a reliable service. Finally, I look forward to the possibility that a different company may eventually offer a competing fibre service in this area, as I would certainly move to that company.

Called, waited 43mins, told it's new monthly total, previous monthly total Â£26 cannot be transferred, we explained that we were told same package at same price can be transferred by VM, but VM customer service will not budge. On opening the first invoice, I found my correct 9 digit account number and area reference, so I tried to register an online account, but this time, VM's website says, an account has already been set up for my NEW account, and it was in the name of our previous flatmate, even though he was on a totally different account number! So I still cannot open on online account! Luckily when I emailed my application to apply for transfer, I was concerned that we only had a verbal assurance from VM regarding retaining the Â£26 monthly bundle cost, so I had mentioned in my email that I'm applying for this transfer based on the assurance that its the same package at the same price. We called again to try and lodge a formal complaint, waited 30mins, call automatically dropped. Called back, waited another 45mins, answered, and as soon as I stated we wanted to make a formal complaint, the call was dropped! As advised by local council consumer services officer, we've sent in a formal written complaint, as we've given up ringing their customer service, and cannot use their website form as it requires an online account which VM's system is unable to allow me to register. Entire experience have been stressful, but more bewildered as to how a supposedly professional company like Virgin Media could have such an unprofessional infantile customer service, and after persistently refusing to reply and broken promises, VM alleges we're late in paying our bills, so now imposing late charges etc and has terminated our service, thus rendering us in serious position of not able to work from home! In desperation, we called VM, waited over 50 minutes in queue, spoke to ""customer service"" who sounded very emphatic, says will take ownership of our complaint, truly understand our case is urgent, will escalate and Manager will get back to us within two hours""That's two days ago, still no reply whatsoever!Have filed complaint with CISAS, the official ofcom regulator, but as this process is going to take weeks, guess VM is using this tactic scam knowing most desperate users, especially those working from home in this CV19 period, would cave in and pay up!How our current system allows such inconsiderate corporates to take advantage of our national plight is beyond me, we will definately not be using this company again and would strongly NOT recommend Virgin Media, shame it's another British sham ...",2.0
848,"I've had an incredibly bad start with Virgin. I called weeks in advance to set up the wifi in my new place to avoid being here working from home without wifi. I received a weirdly garbled text from Virgin late on a Saturday night that my Monday installation was being moved back nearly three additional weeks later. I got repeat messages -- one a day after the original installation date and then the same message two days after -- telling me that the external work had been completed. However, when I called to try to move my installation date earlier, they could only move it 1.5 days earlier. The customer service agent sounded like a robot just repeating, ""I'm sorry but we have no availabilities sooner"" even when that wasn't a response to what I was actually saying (I heard them the first time). It feels very clear to me that they don't care that it takes them SIX weeks to set up wifi, which is an utterly absurd amount of time. If there are not enough availabilities for engineers to set up wifi for customers within six weeks, they clearly need to hire more engineers because right now they are providing apalling customer service.",2.0

Gave them plenty of notice, even said that if I could sign up with them again once Iâd moved (moving in with a friend whoâs on a contract with BT), I would. Not now. NEVER AGAIN! Just on todayâs calls alone, I held for around 45 mins before getting to the moving home team. Spoke to the guy who answered for 15 mins, he told me that the billing team would deal with my complaint, so I asked to be put through to them. Held for another 30 mins only for them to hang up on me. Called back again, finally got through to billing after another 35 mins, and and then got the same answer.   They sent the packaging for returning the kit to my new address 3 weeks early, now Iâm being emailed and txtâd saying Iâll incur a penalty charge if I donât return it. Iâm still paying them for the service! Direct debit of Â£54 comes out on 13 August, I move out on 10 August and was originally told the final bill would be just over Â£3. So do they generate a final invoice for this amount? They certainly donât. They say they will still take the direct debit of Â£54 and then send a cheque for the credit (yes, you read it right - a cheque!!!). Immediately? No, why stop there. Theyâll send it via post after 45 days. What the heck!!! Who uses cheques? And why 45 days you may well ask. Apparently it takes that long to process. Seriously?!  And as if that wasnât enough to send me over the edge, then the final straw was when I checked whether they had my new address on file to actually send the cheque to. I thought it wouldnât be safe to assume that as the boxes for the kit had been sent to my new address it would follow that one department might actually communicate with another. Just as well I checked - billing didnât have this on my account. They do now.  I feel sorry for the man and the woman who I spoke to this morning as theyâre just on the other end of the line.

915,"Thanks to Virigin Media, I got a new Broadband contract that cut off my Internet during Homeoffice, costs me Â£20 more than my previous Virgin contract with the same bandwidth and bills me Â£113 for account change. Neither the customer service hotline nor support wanted to help me, so maybe this gets more visibility. My flatmate moved out in the beginning of the year and I was supposed to take over his Virigin contract which was supposed to end in May 2020. I filled out a form to transfer accounts and have not heard anything for another 2 months.A bill for Â£80.86 arrived. Where our previous bills were Â£29 each. Charges for an account change and a monthly package price of Â£49. I tried to create a Virgin Media Online account to get insights on my contract and billing, unfortunately the online account was still registered to my old flatmates email address. I couldnât request a change of online account owner, nor could I login without the email. So my 2 problems are: - I got billed more than I was previously paying- I did not have any access to my Virgin Account and was not able to create a new one with the account number stated on the invoice  So I gave up and called customer support. The lady asked for the pin â which I never received for this account. Luckily, I could provide her with my personal data, so she could access the account. She explained that the Â£29 were for the first year only and after some discussion she offered me a package with a lower bandwidth for Â£36 instead of Â£49. I agreed.I also explained to her that I donât have access to my online account, she said that she would email me including the confirmation of the account changes and the link to get access to my online account. None of the above happened. Problem 1 and 2 still unsolved. 2 months later, we received another invoice for Â£80.86, a letter confirming the account changes and stating a discount for the month of May and another invoice for Â£113.98. And the worst of all, our Internet got cut off. Itâs lockdown, we are doing homeoffice and we canât get our work done without Wifi. I am more than happy to pay my bills, but I am not accepting to be treated like this as a customer. I called customer service again. This time it took a while until I was even able to speak to someone because the automated voicemail asked me to pay the outstanding bill first. Eventually, I got to speak to someone. I was asked to provide my account number (got it on the bill), my name (obvious), account pin (I never had it), address (got it) and finally my birthday (got it). Then I was told the information was wrong and she could not discuss the account further with me. She asked for the sort code which is linked to the account as a last resort. Since I never provided any nor had access to my account I could not provide it. She said that there is nothing she can do for me due to security reasons. Why did it work the first time then? I asked her to escalate it internally, so she created a complaint and told me that her manager will be in touch. That has not happened yet. I did pay the bill now to be able to work from home, but this is a horrible customer experience. I am going to terminate this contract asap and avoid Virgin Media in the future. 0 Problems solvedI had to pay Â£113 paid instead of normal Â£29I'm stuck with this contract until May 2021& I still have no access to my Virgin Media Account Never again.",2.0

When we received VM email confirming transfer complete with new account number, we logged on website to set up online account and ddm, but VM website says A/c number wrong, and requested Area reference which isn't stated anywhere! We called, wait in queue for 25mins, answered, told new account number not coincide with my name, cannot proceed, refused to help further! Then received email from VM with my first invoice for Â£52 per month, not Â£29! Called, waited 43mins, told it's new monthly total, previous monthly total Â£26 cannot be transferred, we explained that we were told same package at same price can be transferred by VM, but VM customer service will not budge. On opening the first invoice, I found my correct 9 digit account number and area reference, so I tried to register an online account, but this time, VM's website says, an account has already been set up for my NEW account, and it was in the name of our previous flatmate, even though he was on a totally different account number! So I still cannot open on online account! Luckily when I emailed my application to apply for transfer, I was concerned that we only had a verbal assurance from VM regarding retaining the Â£26 monthly bundle cost, so I had mentioned in my email that I'm applying for this transfer based on the assurance that its the same package at the same price. We called again to try and lodge a formal complaint, waited 30mins, call automatically dropped. Called back, waited another 45mins, answered, and as soon as I stated we wanted to make a formal complaint, the call was dropped! As advised by local council consumer services officer, we've sent in a formal written complaint, as we've given up ringing their customer service, and cannot use their website form as it requires an online account which VM's system is unable to allow me to register. Entire experience have been stressful, but more bewildered as to how a supposedly professional company like Virgin Media could have such an unprofessional infantile customer service, we will definately not be using this company again and would strongly NOT recommend Virgin Media, shame it's another British sham",2.0

934,"Virgin Media wired up the next-door neighbour's technology incorrectly and has caused many problems to this address, also having carried out work - no doubt also way below safety-standard protocols  - to another neighbour's house in the area, too.  When the company is called about the problem, they lie, saying that they have checked the property's wiring, when they haven't, despite these effects having caused all sorts of issues such as extreme static-charge in and around the house to life-threatening levels, radioactive effects hitting the immune-system and high-pitch frequency effects causing ear-aches for days, the company having had all of these details relayed to them. Virgin Media does not care about the lives of people, they care only about profit via aggressive sales tactics and bad wiring. Stay away. They are bad people. Five years these effects have hurt people and Virgin Media simply does not want to take responsibility for their under-trained representative's mistakes because they do not wish to be seen as liable. The ISP we were with at the time even stated that Virgin Media has messed up their own installations of technology in the past. These people are some of the lowest of the low. Surrounded by advertising and plenty of profit which people keep feeding them without thinking about the consequences. Am sure that if there was really proper, alternative regulation to the mirage of an organisation that is Ofcom, a proper international regulatory counter-corruption organisation that was able to deal with these types of criminal companies, then Virgin Media, as well as companies like Vodafone, would not be trading (maybe down the odd back-alley).",2.0

Join Virgin Media:-If you have literally nothing to do and enjoy endless hours waiting to speak to customer services and then getting repeatedly cut off after your 55 minute waits (rack up 60+ hours of calls over 9 months trying to resolve a few things Virgin should never have done e.g. charging you for a TV package you cancelled 8 months prior -when you promptly returned the TV box to them 8 months earlier and acknowledged receipt of it. This has been going on since mid 2019 and now June 2020 so way before the pandemic before that is used as an excuse! -If you enjoy being sent from department to department since no-one can resolve simple issues, hours and hours wasted, calls are routinely disconnected after long waits and if they repeatedly promise you that a manager will call you back -know that they wonât! -If you enjoy being overcharged for all sorts of thing.-If you enjoy being put on a overpriced broadband contract (almost double the offers they have online) which you never agreed to after your last contract ended and you repeatedly told them you didnât want to be on a new contract (which they agreed to) but would only be on a rolling one until they resolved the issues (which it took them 8 months to do)! They agreed one price for the rolling contract but charged Â£12 extra /month and refused to refund it or listen to their recorded calls. As an extra bonus they will charge you another Â£40 set up fee for the 2nd/new overpriced contract that you never agreed to and will refuse to refund this illegal set up fee.-If you enjoy a dodgy service (when I had the TV box it only worked 40-50% of the time so I ended up just not watching it as Iâd have to call Virgin each time and it was too painful. The internet is fine (where I am in central London, canât speak for elsewhere) but several issues even with that. Iâm assuming that most would disagree re the internet being fine as the WhatsApp group for my area -300+ people- are always complaining about Virginâs internet.-Etc. I could literally carry on with numerous other examples but have wasted too much time already. Literally feel like I've been tortured by Virgin Media as they messed up so many things and one issue took 8 months and about 60 hours of me calling and still not resolved -promised calls back by managers I never got, could never get through, etc. So painful. Iâve just paid them their illegal charges to be rid of them and to cancel the contract but will write a more detailed report for the Communication and Internet Adjudication Scheme (CISAS) -Virgin is not signed up with the main Ombusman services so CISAS is who you contact if you if have an issue with Virgin.

However, days later, the order had not gone through. I had to ring multiple times and basically got told they would not honour the previous agreement. So patronising (I used to work for another provider, and hold a Masters degree in Telecommincation Engineering, but they treat me like I'm an idiot). Pack of lies.  We're now stuck with them as my back was against the wall.  I wish I'd switched. Shouldn't have touched them with a bargepole! This is the latest of the issues I've had with them.  Soon after we had their BB my email stopped working.  They blamed all my clients (on iOS, Windows, Ubuntu and Android) when it was their servers.

So many issues and a lack of quality. If it's working the speed is generally good (especially as we can't currently get VDSL here) though the TV service leaves much to be desired with missed recordings and the like.  We've enjoyed advertised speeds with no sign of contention, good latency and reasonably reliable WiFi from the Arris hub. However, when things go wrong, and they will, the Customer Service is dire and is bad on so many levels.

I am currently getting 0.5Mb/a right beside the router.  You contact customer service and they waffle on, spoon feeding you a load of rubbish. The worst provider going by a significant margin.

991,"Virgin is fast. Unfortunately, it isn't very reliable, and their Customer Service and Tech Support is incredibly poor. This is what happens when you outsource the majority of your tech support to Indian Call Centres. Virgin seem to use ""speed, speed, speed!"" as an exclusive measurement of connection performance. If you're having any issues, then they'll immediately blame your Wi-Fi connection, even if you're not using Wi-Fi (like me). They don't seem to care about the quality or reliability of your connection which can cause more problems than simply the speed of your connection. It is suspected that many of their reliability problems are caused by over-subscribing their network - trying to accommodate more customers than their infrastructure can physically handle. I find it hard to recommend Virgin for consumers right now - if you can get a decent connection from BT/Openreach, then perhaps you should go with them instead.",2.0

I'm therefore being discriminated against new customers.  I've currently been offered a package at Â£38 (best deal they can offer) which is online to new customers at Â£29.99. This is unethical and I do not understand how they get away with this shameful business practice.* They said to me I could not move to another provider as currently Corona Virus restrictions mean their competitors cannot complete any installs.  They are using this as a tool to keep prices high knowing I can't go to their competitors with current movement restrictions. Further:* Their Customer Services have been extremely poor for a number of years. One example is they cannot send my bills to my personal email address - because I used it at a previous address when I moved house. I could go on, but will spare all the details.* Virgin Media also said that if I cancel, then no one else can take out a contract with Virgin at my address for at lease 3 months.",2.0

We can't cancel our contract without incurring an Â£80 penalty fee, because Virgin record the intermittent outages (i.e out for 10 minutes at a time, every half hour) as separate incidents, and thus the outage doesn't last long enough to trigger the cancellation clause. We're literally being held hostage. Avoid at all costs.",1.0
999,"I am giving Virgin Media 1 star because there is no 0 star option. They have absolutely the worst customer-service of all the ISP's (we own 12 properties and use several ISP's), as well as being the worst for broadband speed and reliability. We have always had problems with VM - both with broadband speed and reliability, and with customer -service. Today was typical of our experience with VM. This morning I had to contact them about issues pertaining to two properties. PROPERTY 1: We have had broadband problems (e.g. upload speed of 0.01Mbps - this is not a typo - just one HUNDREDTH of one Mbps) for more than 1 MONTH, and received a text message (for the third time!) advising the problem is fixed, even though it is not. Spent 52 MINUTES ON HOLD (this is not that unusual for VM even before the coronavirus) when I called. When I finally got through, VM said they know about the problem and their engineer will sort it out asap. I said VM has been saying this for weeks and asked why VM keeps sending such messages if they know the problem is not fixed - VM did not have an answer for that. I advised that on 4 March I wanted to speak to a manager, was told that none were available to speak to me, but was promised that a note would be placed on the account for a manager to call me back within 48 hours. I advised that it has now been 20 DAYS and no call, only to be told that the last person I spoke to at VM did not place a note on the account for a manager to call! I asked the lady I was speaking to today to place a note on the account for a manager to call and confirm to me that she has definitely done so. However, I do not hold out any hope that a manager from VM will bother to call me. PROPERTY 2: Potential serious issue with a new account, tried to call VM, kept on hold for 87 MINUTES, then recorded message saying they cannot process my call and to call back later. Found VM email address on an old email from VM, and sent an email explaining the problem. Received an automated reply saying VM do not monitor this email address and to contact them through the website. Website options do not match the issue and I keep getting directed to FAQ's with no option to send message to VM - spent the last HOUR trying to find some way to email or message them with no luck. Unfortunately, in the two properties above VM is the only ISP that can provide fibre-broadband at the moment, so we have no option but to use them. However, we have decided that for the other properties we will no longer use VM and will cancel the other VM accounts as soon we are out of the contract period. For anyone who is thinking of opening an account with Virgin Media I say if what you really want is very poor broadband-service and worse customer-service, and you really, really enjoy spending literally hours on hold to sort out issues, then VM is definitely for you. The rest of us who want reasonably dependable broadband and good customer-service will go elsewhere.",1.0

They don't seem to understand how their own systems work and when you ask for their managers email to complain they give you a generic office email so they can hide all their many issues and lack of ability. They don't seem to understand their own systems. Really poor.,1.0

1079,"I had only bad experiences with Virgin Media, from start to finish:1. Sales: I called Virgin Media to get broadband. The guy was on a Monday morning mood, could barely understand what he was saying, he made no effort to speak clearly, instead he started shouting in the phone thinking that might help. He gave me broadband and mobile in a bundle which was good as I wantedmobile as well, but thinking of getting it from EE. We arrange for service installation on day x between 13.00 - 18.00.2. I see one day that there is a cable lump coming out of the ground on my patio in front of the house. The patio looked messy, I could see that too. No one told me anything about this, so I thought it might be the council doing whatever works in the area. Really poor communication from Virgin.3. Day x comes and the technician gives me a call at 12.00 saying he will be at my property in 10 min. I say I'm away as I made plans for the morning and will be there just before 13.00 when the allocated slot for installation should begin. The guy shouts at me in the phone and says if I'm not there at 12.30 he will leave the property and mark this as a missed appoitment. Then hangs up on me. I had to rush through traffic as I was away on a course in Birmingham.Finally got home at 12.45 and saw the guy already drilled 3 holes in the house and mounted an outside box. All these without my approval and in my absence.I immediately stop him from progressing the work as it is a rented house and didn't have landlords approval. He immediately starts moaning that I am wasting his time and that I should've get the landlords agreement before hand. I say you're wasting my time as it is before 13.00 and in theory this is my time. I say I didn't know we had to drill holes etc as no one told me what the installation involves. I thought it will use the existing infrastructure in the house,i.e. just swap the existing router from Vodafone with the Virgin Media one and set that up. The guy keeps sucking his teeth and moaning about the waste of time. At 13.00 he leaves saying he won't waste anymore of his time on me. How rude! He made such a big deal of his time, that he actually screwed everything up and leftat 13.00 when the allocated slot was starting. I wanted to mention it to him, the fact that before 13.00 is actually my time, but I was afraid the guy will snap and start being violent. So I left it there.4. Later on a lady from the pre-install team calls asking what happenned. I tell her the story and then say I would like to cancel my services as I didn't appreciate the technicians behaviour. She insists I should carry on with the installation and asked for an installation date. In the mean time I went to the agency down town to talk to the letting agent about this as they weren't answering the phone. They said it's ok to install and the landlord is happy with that.I informed the lady about this, but said I wouldn't be able to be available for the installation soon, so I'll go to a different supplier anyway who will post the router through the letter box for me to install it myself. She kept insisting I should go forward with installation. She put so much pressure on me and also started making me feel bad for not finishing the installation saying they went to such great lenghts to get another installation date for me. I realised the abuse and signed out saying I definitely don't want to go for Virgin Media services anymore. Now they ring me every day to ask me to install the services and every day I say no. I'll have to bar the caller at some point as this can't continue like this. Really abusive people. I would like to get in touch with a regulatory authority to mention this as I don't think this is good behaviour. I actually think it's abusive!!!

Originally had huge issues over receiving the box because it hadn't been delivered and each time i rang to ask, I got told it had already been delivered which was very clear it hadn't. Spent two whole evenings on the phone to them, until I lost my patience and they then decided to send someone out to me to install it free of charge. At the time i told them i wouldn't be paying for the time it took them to install it which they agreed. They offered compensation of Â£5 for everyday late it was but sent me through a cheque for a quarter of this. To top that off i noticed a charge added to my bill for the amount of the cheque they sent me, so they had charged me for my compensation! A month later my complaint got resolved because they couldn't get hold of me, despite having my email, phone number and home address. Obviously they try so hard (NOT). I set up a direct debit for payments and it was showing on my bank account but they didn't collect the money and have tried to charge me for a late payment fee. Needless to say, i am fuming, another 2 hours on the phone to them. Be very aware they try to slip in additional charges on to your bill and thy purposefully make the bills unclear. Compensation still hasn't been added on despite them saying it had been added.

1143,"Copy of my complaint email to Virgin CEO Lutz Schueler: Dear Mr Shueler, I am writing this email whilst on hold with your customer service team, 41 minutes in at this point, being passed from customer service to cancellations and back.... I have been a customer of Virgin for over 15 years and have had enough over the last month with my broadband not working properly. After giving Virgin over 9 attempts to resolve the issue I have now decided to cancel the contract as I cannot afford to be taking time off for your engineers to visit and being late for work whilst trying to resolve the issues. Not to mention the many hours spent on the phone with your customer service, wasting my evenings and weekends. 1 hour 3 minutes on the phone with customer service & counting..... I have now been told that I will have to pay a penalty as I am contracted to Virgin until February 2020... this after paying you for a service that you were unable to provide. I am sure that under my consumer rights I should not be penalised for cancellation of a service that you did not provide adequately. Oh, I have just been advised that customer service closes @ 9pm and that someone will call me tomorrow. Over an hour on the phone...wow! This attempt to play hardball with customers and pressure/ force them to keep parting with their money for an inferior, sometimes non existent service will only lead to Virgin Media gradually losing total confidence from their customers and as you well know bad reviews travel much wider than good ones. One of the issues that pushed me over the edge, was Virgin's total disregard for their customers time, offering a discount of Â£32, for not providing adequate service for a month impacting on homework, coursework, working from home and general tasks which are all very dependent on having an internet connection. In addition the 2 days off work for engineers visits, being late for work and a wild guess of 10's of hours wasted on the phone with customer service - at least it felt that long. Plus penalty clauses for termination of a service not received as paid for. I would like to think that a reputable company the size of Virgin respects and treats their loyal customers fairly, which is why I have gone to the principal directly with this predicament. Normally large organisations take their lead from the top and are the mirror image of their leaders. I would like you to intervene, contact your cancellation team, to advise them that they are entitled to only 3 attempts to resolve the issues - let alone 9 attempts, before they are obliged to accept my termination of the contract without any further penalty charges applying. On another note, I have been contemplating moving all 4 of our mobile telephone contracts to Virgin Mobile, actually moved the 1st one just last weekend - which I am now thinking was a mistake and maybe I should utilise the 14 day return/ cancellation period. All of Virgin Media should be very careful how they treat their customers as there may be knock on consequences if consumers feel that they are taken for granted. Customers are easily lost but very difficult to then regain their trust. I will await your response for the next 7 days, until Thursday 24th October 2019, after which I will be forced to make a formal complaint to OFCOM and request their recommendations on my consumer rights relating to this complaint. I most sincerely hope that you will respond to this complaint and use it to try to improve Virgin Media's service provided to it's customers, as well as change my current impression of the company, too big to care about their customers views.  Best regards *THE RESPONSE*: We would like to thank you for taking the time to contact us today. We are very sorry to hear that you are unhappy and we will endeavour to resolve your issues as soon as possible. Lutz is currently not available to deal with your complaint personally, however we have passed your email onto a member of his team, and they will be in touch with you as soon as possible in order to assist you with your queries. We look forward to discussing this matter with you in the future. Kind regards, Roopa Murugan On behalf of Lutz Schuler.  Nearly 4 weeks have passed, nothing more from the CEO's office, I do wonder where this disdain for customers comes from, from the top maybe?  I THEN HAD THIS EMAILED TO ME: Get the Bigger bundle with M200 Fibre Broadband for Â£49 a month, if you stay..

If you have any questions about your bill, please visit My Virgin Media. Kind regards, The Virgin Media team   SO TO RECAP: They offered Â£49 per month + M200 broadband in their email and when I clicked on the link to accept that I then got a confirmation of Â£56 per month + M100 Broadband, this to try to convince me to stay, hahahah. When I contacted them to ask why the difference in offer to confirmation they told me they couldn't change anything and that I would have to send them proof of the offer. I have to prove what THEY sent me in a an email, I still can't believe it whilst writing this. I then advised them that I want to cancel that change in contract and revert back to my cancellation date of 16/11 as they did not supply the contract that they originally offered. They had the cheek to say that I have to give them 30 days notice and pay penalties. I have advised them that I will only pay for my services until the 16/11, the cancelation date agreed without penalties before they tricked me into extending the contract. I will cancel my direct debit and they can take me to court to explain to a Judge how they tried to con me. *** BEWARE OF VIRGIN MEDIA _ CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A SHAMBLES_YOU GET PASSED FROM INDIA TO SCOTLAND TO INDIA TO SCOTLAND...â¦...DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU***",1.0

They also tried to sound like they had done me a favour! Second time... I said I was canceling my account and going with a different provider. They had offered that if I take a virgin mobile sim I could keep the same package and reduce my total by Â£50 a month. GREAT. Except that they still charged me Â£144 for my package and then when I wouldn't pay for a sim extra Â£22 they sent the Â£22 bill to a debt collector after just 30 days. This is where they despite being paid Â£144 a month for the rest of my services decided they wanted two Bill's in advance again. Are you confused yet? Because I was. This is so I have to keep using their services for another two months and perhaps in the hope that I will calm down. Really feel they should be investigated. Their staff apparently cannot switch accounts on or transfer calls to customer care unless the amount on the screen is paid. Whether that amount is wrong or not. Worst provider... I dont care how fast your broadband service is or if you can get me all the champions league matches ... for what you're charging I can get club season tickets flights and accommodation and there's noway it costs you anywhere near that ammount to run these services. This doubling up on billing is a joke. Do you give your staff their wages in advance? I doubt it. Enough said.. I'm no longer paying Virgin media for the privilege of recieving this pain in the backside every other month.  No longer under contract.",3.0

1168,"Promising promises at the beginning when you sign a contract. Then everything goes wrong. Since the first week of my 12 months contract, I had an issue with the broadband. I was making written complains and had to call them for the first 2 months. The broadband was unstable, cutting me off the internet constantly. Some evenings, when you come back after work back home, you could not use the internet as there was an issue with the signal (Virgin has admitted it). And that lasts for weeks. I never received compensation for that ether can't use internet for days but they charged me for the full amount even thou I ask for the partial refund). After few first months of beeing with Virgin and having an issue with the signal, they don't even bother to send the engineer to check my connection, to check the router or whatsover to solve this.After 2 months of everyday complains by me, they send me an email explaining that there is nothing wrong with the internet and that I have a right to seek an advice by the independent company. So I decided to just wait for the end of my 12 months contract and look for another broadband provider. The instructions on how to end the contract are not clear on the Virgin website. It says that if you have a 12 months contract, you don't need to do anything, just give them a call at the end of your contract. But when I called them, they say that I need to give them 30 days' notice. Which wasn't advertised. They suggest me to read the fine print.  More issues raises with my last bill. When I gave them a 30 days notice, I received the bill for the full month (because I was late with my notice, the amount should be for 21 days, not for 31 days of that month). So I called them again. I've spoken with the customer service, and the agent agrees with me and she promised to me that the final amount will be recalculated and sent to me. Which I never received. Just before the disconnection of the services, I have received the same bill again (of Â£44.50) plus the bill stated that my next bill is on the way for the amount of Â£96. Now that is ridiculous. I called them again... the agent this time ensures me that this is a mistake and that they will correct the bill and will send me the next day. The very next day I have received a bill for Â£96 instead of Â£30 (because Â£44.50 was for a full month from 1st till 31st. I used services from 1st till 21st, the amount should be ~Â£30. That what agent agrees and ensure me). So instead of Â£30 once again I received the bill for the amount of Â£96. THAT IS TRIPLED! And that is after the correction?!  I am still fighting for my rights at the moment! My suggestion - avoid Virgin media by any means, there are better broadband providers than this. The customer service is pathetic. The broadband is pathetic as well. Been using many different providers and Virgin is one of the worst ever!!  If you in a similar situation - don't be afraid to fight for your rights! You can ask for professional help at resolver.co.uk Do not trust empty promises before you sign a contract. You will be hooked and will never receive a services that you were hoping for, the customer service is careless.

They reduced the bill from over Â£100 to Â£36.I honestly believe if I had not called I would have still had an incorrect final bill. 3.

They were advertising a great deal for new customers. I had been with Virgin for 10 years and was told that new customer offer was only available once per household. Despite me telling Virgin Media that I was unemployed and was looking for ways to reduce my monthly outgoings, I was twice offered a new deal that would be more than I was already paying. A clear indication that they were not listening to me. I re-requested that they give me their best deal. The âbestâ they could do was nearly double the new customer offer I mentioned earlier. I declined their offers and said I would be looking for an alternative provider. I was out of contract and was free to leave. âGoodâ DealsI did some research and found what looked like a fairly good deal with Plusnet. Contacted Plusnet, I accepted their deal and agreed an installation date. I called Virgin Media back to confirm that I wanted to leave. After trying again to sell me a new âbetterâ deal and then realising they couldnât come close to the price from Plusnet. I told them I wanted my phone number transferred to the new service provider and a member of the Virgin Media team talked me through the service termination and phone number export process. I agreed to their âminimum 30-dayâ termination clause, making my last day with Virgin Media day 13 September. I was told by Virgin Media that only live phone numbers can be exported, so they would leave my phone service as active until after the export had completed. The other services (TV and broadband) would be set to end on 13 September as agreed. I new service was due to go live with Plusnet on 11 September, so this date seemed to provide a good overlap, in case there were any hiccups. HiccupsOn 29 August, my broadband and TV service stopped working. I called Virgin Media to ask for help. I was told that my service was terminated âas agreedâ, when Plusnet issues the phone number export request on 29 August. I said that was not what I agreed and was told, but Virgin insisted that there was nothing they could do to turn my TV and broadband services back on until the previously agreed date of 13 September. Virgin suggested I ask Plusnet if they could bring the installation date forward. I called Plusnet and was told they could not move the date forward, as there were not free slots before 11 September. I called Virgin back and spoke to a more friendly individual, who did some research and said she could request a reconnection, she would need to fill in some forms and it would take up to 72 hours. 72 HoursCan and went, still not service, another called to Virgin Media, another unhelpful team member. The only option to get the service back is to if I âcancel the export and revert back to Virgin Mediaâ as my service provider. If I do that, I get my service back in around 3 days, but I will lose my phone number, forever. I decide not to do this and the issue to be escalated. âIt wonât helpâ to escalate my issue Iâm told by the Virgin Media team member. I ask to speak with her supervisor. No that canât be done either. I ask for a formal complaint to be raised. In a later phone call, I am told that a Virgin Media team member in the âExport teamâ made the mistake that caused my service to be terminated 14 days earlier than agreed. No responseStill heard nothing about anything except a few curt, apparently automated, emails telling me to send back their equipment or I will be charged. I sent back all their equipment 13 days prior to the most recent demanding email, so I call Virgin Media again, to be told âwe know the equipment is on its wayâ, but the system takes 10 working days to notify them of this. I suggest they should change the tone of their emails if the biggest delay in the process is caused by their internal system communication. I was treated like it was my fault that a Virgin Media internal system takes 10 days to notify another Virgin Media team. And Virgin Media isnât responsible if an automated email causes upset. If an email sent by Virgin Media to a Virgin Media customer causes upset, whose fault it then? It must be my fault; I mean I am the customer. Based on my previous experience this should have been obvious, my mistake. 45 DaysMoving on to more pleasant things then, the Virgin Media team member Iâm speaking with tells me my refund cheque with me mailed to me within the next 45 days. I ask for clarification, âDid you say 4 to 5 days?â The reply was a definite âNo, 45 daysâ. Forty-five days to send me a refund cheque. What The ****? They have to be kidding me, right? No, it turns out Iâm silly for thinking otherwise. Apparently, 45 days is normal and acceptable. The only thingThe only thing that takes longer than the time Virgin Media take to respond to complaints is how long it will take them to send a refund! This is not actually true, as I havenât received any communication from Virgin Media about my complaint yet, so donât know how long I will have to wait for that, but I wonât be at all surprised if itâs longer than 45 days!",2.0

Then, after your fixed term runs out, they start bombarding you with bi-annual unjustifiable price increases, and when you threaten to leave them, they offer you a ""discount"", which seems nice at first, but after a couple of years with this network provider you realise that you have to spend approx 45 minutes every six months on the phone with these morons to stop them from extorting you.

They overcharge/charge for random things, but woe betide you if you try to resolve it. I'd imagine I'm somewhere around Â£300 out of pocket for constant errors you cannot resolve. You can ring & get one result, but call about the same issue & get a completely contradictory response, usually resulting in them trying to charge you again. I have never once had a decent experience with them, and am so glad I left for Sky. I tried to contact the complaints department and the contact box never even transferred to an agent! It's appalling that such a huge company would have 0.4/10 & not do a single thing to resolve it - tells you all you need to know about their customer care vs money grabbing. Eurgh, they've been an absolute nightmare from start to finish, & by the end I was paying Â£10 extra for a bill than the deal I initially signed up for & was 'guaranteed' indefinitely.

Since then their service has become well beyond terrible.I have spent hours on the telephone wasted to somebody who calls them selves Mark, Jane, Peter and so on, who does not have the slightest grasp of English , who seem to go out of their way to be unhelpful.This company has become so bad that I am totally bewildered why Sir Richard Branson allows the Virgin brand to be used.They add in little extras onto the bills without telling you, and when you try and find out why, you will spend hours arguing and not get any answers. If you do you won't understand them. When we were moving and had to cancel or change address on every service we had, about 90% of our time was taken up by our dealings with Virgin Media. I ended up ripping out their equipment and carting it  into their last remaining shop in the area (as they have closed them all down) and dumping it on the shop counter.

Apparently it's too complicated to put the option to leave on the website.- I was overcharged on my final bill. Not only do they not properly notify you, they do not reimburse you automatically. Unless you notice and go through the same process of calling of trying to call them, your money is gone.- I have them 5-6 weeks notice before my move. They failed to send the box for returning the equipment. One month after moving address I get threatening emails that I will be charged Â£40 of I don't return it.

1264,"I've been with VM for over 11 years. In that time, I think the internet has gone down only a handful of times and it has been consistently very fast.  The reason I'm leaving them is cost. I'm basically on their minimum package but still getting charged Â£60 a month for 70Mbps internet. That may be reasonable value, but I just don't need that speed. And they're unable, or unwilling, to offer me anything less. Trying to actually leave them has been fairly stressful. You can't cancel on their website, or via email. Nor do they make their postal address readily available. You have to go through their awful call centre. If you go through the menu to leave VM, you'll be put on hold for half an hour and then get through to someone who can't actually perform the task that the menu took you too. They then put you through to their retentions department - another half hour wait.  After countless attempts to actually talk to someone who would cancel the service, and failing, I ended up finding their postal address on the VM forum, and sending a cancellation via recorded delivery. It's one thing to try and encourage customers to stay, I was initially quite willing to be persuaded, but after this experience I can't wait to be rid of them. They seem intent to obstruct you from leaving, and they do it in a ""you can't do that"" rather than ""what can we do to make you stay"" sort of way. Got a BT line installed the other day.

Sent letters (by recorded delivery) and also contacted another broadband provider.  It seems when the other provider contacted VM to transfer my telephone number the disconnections/retentions dept became involved- they offered me a decent package at a reasonable price and I was tempted to stay - I queried if the cancellation letters I had sent would affect anything and was assured that if I agreed to a new contract then they would not take effect.  GUESS WHAT - go away on holiday and aware of a problem, so contact VM to find out that whilst I have been away my services have been cancelled from my letter!  I spent over an hour on the phone trying to get my services re-instated - no form of apology - they admitted there was a recent contract but no notes on the system to say to ignore my cancellation letter so the service had been cancelled.  They would happily set up a new contract but at a higher price than I had agreed- of course I refused and demanded to have the agreed contract re-instated - got passed between several members of their staff to be told the same thing - asked to speak to a manager - was told I was going to be put through, then the same person came back and told me the manager would say the same thing!

When it works the WiFi signal is shocking in a small house it's down to dial up speed upstairs, the customer service team suggest WiFi boosters which really shouldn't be needed as my old router was absolutely fine. I've been palmed off for over a year by them, eventually had an engineer come out and discover there's a fault on my cable and it's been there since I took out my package. That doesn't cure the shocking WiFi signal (lots online about the hub 3.0 having shocking signal) I can't wait to have it took out in 2 months it's been a massive disappointment, the customer service team are so bad it's almost like they're trying to be terrible they'll hang up on you if they can't palm you off with nonsense. After a year they've finally sent someone out to fix something that they were told about a year ago but just palmed me off. For how much it costs I'm amazed they think a solution to fix the bad WiFi reception on the hubs is to install WiFi boosters around my 3 bed semi so it's usable when previous cheap routers have been perfect.",2.0

Over the past year we have had on 2 occasions a technician come out to âfixâ the service and both times we have been left with a worse connection and service. To start with the price is constantly rising as if it wasnât extortionally expensive already. They say the price is rising so they can give you a âbetter qualityâ of service which is a total lie! They just con you out of paying more and more money. You do not get the type of service you pay for. When it actually works the WiFi is reasonably fast, but half the time it does not have an internet connection. It is totally unreliable. When there is more than 3 devices using the WiFi it becomes incredibly slow even though we are paying to be able to use 5+ devices at high speed. Considering we donât live in a mansion you wouldâve thought the connection would be able to reach every room in the house, no. The WiFi connection Is only available in the living room the router is in, the room directly above it, and the kitchen directly next to it. This leaves 3 rooms without a connection. Since we pay in excess of Â£60 you would of thought it would be able to reach every room in the house which are not far from the router at all. On top of this the online and telephone customer service is SHOCKING! Not a single person I spoke to seemed to actually want to help out with your problem, they basically told us if we didnât like what we got, bugger off somewhere else!! Oh by the way, this was after calling multiple times and every time being put on hold for almost 40 minutes! If you have to wait that long to be able to speak to someone who âdeals with technical problemsâ or who âdeals with cancelling accountsâ there is clearly A LOT of unhappy high paying customers. Also, when you finally get through to speak to someone, it is very difficult to understand them as none of them seem to be able to speak proper English and you spend most your time repeating yourself or getting them to repeat themselves. There is no long term customer loyalty. Before we started having these problems in the past year, we have been with virgin media for probably 10 years and we have received no rewards, discounts or upgrades on deals whatsoever. The price just keeps on rising! When we very first joined we mustâve of been paying around Â£30 for amazing service, and now itâs done a complete 360. We pay over double the amount for the worst possible service you could ask for. after trying to get a hold of service teams for 4 days, we have finally been able to happily CANCEL our account with them and joined with EE broadband who have offered us a super fast WiFi deal at nearly half the price.

No manners, no idea of what customer service is, they basically don't care! Our virgin media services were disconnected in March 2019 and we were expecting a cheque of Â£42.96. I have been following it up with Virgin Media and was told to wait for 60 days from 24.04.19 as cheque takes 60 days to process.  I called Virgin Media again on 05.07.19 and was told that the cheque was sent to a different address (that we lived at 4 years ago). I was then told to go to that address and get the cheque as this is the address that I had given for any correspondence. I tried to explain that services were not provided at that address but our current address and we no longer live at that address, so cheque should be sent to our current address.  Absolutely no apologies from the customer service representative who said that it is not a mistake but miscommunication and asked me to ring next week to sort it out with another team.  Asked to be put through to a Manager- spoke to Mushtak who repeated the same thing and blamed me for providing wrong correspondence address (which I never had, why would I?). I asked Mushtak how I can complain- he said that he is the Manager and will deal with complaints. Asked him how I can contact his senior Manager- was told that he cant provide details- he is the one who will deal with this. I said to him that I don't want him to deal with this but he still would not give me any information re: escalation process. Don't understand what is the point of asking all the security information including address on the phone when the cheque is still sent to a previous address. Absolutely appalled by the the customer service and their attitude towards their customers.

Last year in March I moaned about the cost and my monthly bill went fromÂ£59 to Â£25 monthly for phone and 200M broadband. The reliability has always been poor and WiFi always patchy but with the router on a shelf upstairs itâs just ok.This March I called as my bill had jumped to Â£44 monthly and ended up cancelling my phone service however I had the rudest operator I have ever spoken to who dropped my call before completing the transaction. Next think, the line got swapped to another provider and someone at Virgin decided I didnât need my broadband either so switched it off. After six calls and several hour wait, three operators promised to reconnect me and apologised for their mistake. Still didnât happen so I called yet again and was told some cock and bull story about OFCOM rules and an 8 day wait to start reconnection even though itâs Virgins fault not mine.Cancelled the direct debit so they can whistle and BT installing this week for free. This would have been bad normally but I had a very major cancer op when our telephone and broadband were off so had lots of additional stress caused by Virgin.

The only way to reset this is to cancel (again) - really cancel, and then wait for them to call back a few days later with much reduced rates. In our case down to Â£12/month. But obviously this will revert again after another 12 months. If you're prepared to go through this hoop every 12 months, good luck to you. For me, this is indicative of their attitude to their customers. See what they can get away with. Make you go through hoops to bring the rate back down. Slide it back up again afterwards. Not an attitude I'm happy with. Secondly, the actual router/modem/internet service was poor. Often dropping out or running slowly.

Due to work commitments we arranged for family to come over to be present when the engineer arrived. I received a call at work saying the engineer would be late arriving at 17.00. At 17.46 I received a text saying the service visit was now on hold while Virgin investigated a network problem. (A whole day wasted for our family members who kindly offered to help). Called Virgin and they offered little explanation as to the cause of the problem only that it was being worked on and they predicted it will be resolved around 01.30 a.m. When I asked how we would be compensated for lack of service they offered Â£5 deduction to our next bill which I said was unexceptionable due to the inconvenience of waiting in all day for an engineer no show. Having been put on hold for what seemed like an eternity they eventually came back with the offer of a Â£10 deduction to our next bill. Later that evening I received a text to say the issue was now resolved, please restart your equipment and wait 30 min. (Which I did). No change still no service.... Again called customer service to get no real help. More trouble shooting which I had already done with countless other customer service reps only to be told they needed to send an engineer to site to investigate further. Having explained the situation again and again and again, we found ourselves right back to where we started with the earliest an engineer could come to site being the start of the following week leaving us without service for 3 and a half days...... I asked how we would now stand to be compensated for the additional lack of service and was told we had been compensated by the system to the maximum level for amount of days without service.  When I asked to be put through to the manager I was transferred but no one answered the call transfer, there was just background office noise. Had to hang up and ring back explaining the  situation again for about the seventh time and again asked to speak to a manager. I was told they were busy and would call back. I said I would wait and they insisted they were too busy to talk and only offered a call back.

Spoke with a lovely lady, was sent a final bill, paid that and returned equipment. They kept billing me as if that hadnât happened. I called them to point this out - after every bill. Got through to different countries each time (I donât have a problem with offshore customer service but it became apparent I was speaking to a different country each time - no wonder they canât communixate) . Always on hold for ages, always ended with them saying they didnât know what had happened but theyâd sent orders for it to be cancelled now (except on one occasion when I was just left on hold for an hour). Escalated by February to texts and phone calls demanding money. Iâve called three times since then and tried to use their text service twice. No luck, and rudeness on the text service (itâs not a smart service or anything - just a random guy texting who seems to have no knowledge or power to escalate). Iâm worried that the next step is bailiffs or debt collectors - frequency of calls is escalating. And all for bills sent months after I cancelled the service!

I said I had done this already prior to calling and it only provided a temporary solution. I was told to do it again and that the problem would be resolved. SÃ¬gnal dropped 30 mins later. Call 2 at 8pm - after being put on hold for a few minutes i was told the service would be back on shortly but they would not give me a time. I told them how important internet was because I work from home and they told me it would be fixed shortly. I was promised a manager would call me back but I received no call back. Service came back on 2 hrs later at 10 pm.The next day I lost internet at exactly the same time in the evening. Call 3 at 8pm - I called up and asked what was going on I was told there was an area fault and that there was nothing they could do until it was fixed. A new story. I said this was unacceptable and demanded to speak to a manager as an uninterrupted service was key for my work. Again I was promised a call but nothing. The next day I had no internet at all and could not work. My wife had to go to a relatives house to get WiFi to work. Call 4 at 8.30 - told the guy on first line support to forget about even trying to start a conversation with me and to put me straight through to a manager. After some resistance he put me through to the most useless of people that I had spoken to in Virgin. He told me that there was an area fault and that it would not be fixed for 8 days and there was nothing he could do, I was not offered a solution. Even though I did not care about compensation (as it was uninterrupted service I needed) I was not offered anything. The worst was that he told me that he could offer me nothing but tell me I had to wait 8 days for the service to resume. I politely told him this was unacceptable and that I would be cancelling my service. Call 5 at 9am - I called cancellations as spoke to a uk department and when asked for the reason I told them it was due to Virgin not committing to the service defined in the contract. Now I donât know who was ********** me because cancellations told me the area fault was with tv (which I did not subscribe to) and not broadband. He told me he would get an engineer out tomorrow and resolve the issue. I subsequently called BT to subscribe to infity my previous provider as I never had any problems with I just though I would try Virgin as it was cheaper for a quicker service.

I have two teenage sons both of whom have naturally increased their internet use over the course of the years I was with Virgin. Both are gamers both like to stream movies, what teenager doesn't. That's where the issues started with this all singing fancy broadband (they claim) Firstly the signal off their VIVID 350 and the Hub 3 is at best weak in upstairs rooms, then add to this the way they apply the fair use policy which involves limiting speeds to below snail pace at weekends when you need it most of all and you get a below standard expensive service.Virgin claim unlimited downloads at high speed, what they don't tell you is they will restrict your service if your a high end user. Now I only found this out when I was leaving Virgin as the girl on the phone let slip that we may have been restricted because of our usage. We were finding 3 weekends out of four the internet seldom worked never mind being restricted and when it was working it was desperately slow.What I find highly amusing now is that the female customer services rep in their cancellation department arrogantly suggested that our use would be subject to restrictions with all other service providers. well here's the thing, I have been with BT for two years now and not only can I get a good signal from their hub all over the house but I also haven't been subject to fair use policy and my lads have only increased their use as have I.

They also make it difficult to get in touch to leave so the best way to get in touch with them is to go onto the website and say you are a new customer - They soon pick up the phone for a chat then !

And having phoned their tech line several times (which is no longer UK based, so had to sit through a solid hour each time listening to somebody speaking pigeon-English very slowly taking me through their step-by-step guide for restarting or switching channels on the router) and having written a formal letter of complaint and almost begging them to send an engineer to check the local box or my line, they sent me a letter saying they were sorry that I was ""unhappy"" with my service, but they legally do not guarantee internet speeds.  It's sad. I was with Virgin for years and didn't mind paying the higher price because the connection was superb, the UK based help centres were always very helpful, and engineer visits were free.

It took an engineer visit to sort this out and the connect started late. As if this wasn't bad enough, during the sales call I was assured I could add a phone line on later on, bringing the total cost of services to Â£42 per month. I called literally 3 days later to act upon this agreement and found they wanted a Â£25 activation fee for the line, and they wouldn't honour the agreed price and wanted to up my charges to Â£43.75 per month. As my father says, it's the big companies you have to watch out for these days.

1629,"Joined via an official virgin media door to door salesman in October 2018. Salesman offered me 50mb broadband, Anytime landline calls, TV player bundle and free sky sports for 3 months â all for Â£32 per month. It sounded like a great deal so I even got a friend to sign up via the same salesman. The numerous problems started from the get-go, I will list it out for easier reading. 1. I repeatedly told the salesman that I have never had virgin media before whilst signing a pre contract in my house. Salesman still went ahead and booked the wrong type of installation (Engineer thought I had a virgin line already installed). So I got a new installation date for 2 weeks later, had to call my previous provider to extend the notification period which was tricky. 2. Also mentioned to the salesman, that I wanted the router to go into my bedroom due to my PC and gaming set ups needing an Ethernet connection and to keep my existing landline number. Salesman promised it can be done. Installation day comes (second time around), engineer immediately dictates where the best place for the router to go ignoring my preference. Engineer made so many excuses not to put it in my bedroom, probably because of the extra work needed, so I gave up and it ended up going in the living room alongside the TV box (I bought a powerline extender for Â£50 just to connect my pc). After the installation, I then find out that my landline number has been changed, I was really frustrated because I have had that number for many years and was looking to keep it. 3. This is where it becomes even darker, I was getting a bit concerned in why I wasnât getting any emails as you do when you join a new provider and I wanted to make an online account. So I called up the customer helpline and they told me itâs because your email was incorrect .com instead of .co.uk. It was written clearly correct on the pre-contract paper handed to me by the salesman, to my shock my friend also had the same problem. 4. Then out of curiosity I told the customer service guy to read out my package and lo and behold I was on a different package weekend calls and nothing about 3 monthsâ free sky sports, it was just a normal package offered online. My friend did the same and got the same outcome, even the email situation .com instead of .co.uk 5. I rang the salesman and he kept lying about it just being a mistake and it will be sorted out (basically he was trying to run down my 14 day cooling off period). He eventually stopped answering calls from me and my friend. I then spoke to a manager from the customer services and he agreed that there was some mis-selling going on and will honour what I was promised if I sent a copy of the pre-contract to his email, which I then did. He then replied that everything was sorted, far from the truth as I saw no change on my account. 6. The last straw, I called again, really wanted to cancel it as I was fed up and 3 days away from the cooling off period. Was told the same thing by a different manager honour the contract etc. I then look at my account again and I see that my first bill is Â£120 including 50-pound installation fee when I was promised free installation. The 2 managers basically messed up my package beyond repair. 7. I then called up to cancel it finally, had to repeat my story every time I called by the way. Advisor said that I donât have to pay a penny because the cancellation is within the 14 day cooling off period. No surprise here, they then sent me a bill a week after cancelling of Â£75 for god knows what reason, had to make further calls to customer service to sort this out, they said it was a mistake donât worry etc.In Summary a had 2-3 weeks of hell, I was a loyal and happy Sky customer before virgin, I got mis-sold by a sly Virgin Salesman called âKevinâ apparently who lied, the customer service from virgin is also appalling most probably due to untrained employees in the Indian call centre, on top of all this the broadband service went down for 2 days in my area during my few days with virgin. At the end had to re-join Sky.

As said, we contracted them for Â£30.00 per month and that bill ended up at Â£80.00 a month. We carried on for 2 months more and changed the service to a different broadband company. To sum up, I basically do not recommend Virgin Media to no one as it will be an utter waste of money and time. PS.

I found an alternative (local, and Â£50.00 a month cheaper) and phoned Virgin to cancel. It took them 35 minutes for a human being to answer, and another ten minutes for me to be connected to the correct person. The person I got must have got out of bed the wrong side. I informed her how long I had been waiting. She said she was not interested in that. She was rude and was as unhelpful as she could be. I stressed when I spoke to her that I wanted my telephone number ported over to my new provider. My new internet provider contacted me to say that they couldnât port my number over because I hadnât told Virgin I wanted that done, despite the fact that I had made it crystal clear to the advisor that that was what I wanted. This necessitated another phone call and another 45-minute wait. The person I got this time assured me that my number would be ported over. The next day I got an e-mail welcoming me to my new Virgin phone service. If it wasnât so serious it would be laughable. Not wanting to have to wait another 45 minutes before speaking to an unhelpful telephone âadvisorâ, I wrote a letter. I got a fairly prompt reply assuring me that all was in hand. They stated that they had tried to contact me by phone. It turned out that three silent phone calls received and interpreted as nuisance calls were actually from them. In a subsequent phone call, that wasnât silent, I was assured that I would get a refund of Â£62.84 that was overpaid because my contract ended half way through a payment period. My contract ended on 25th August. It is now 5th October and I am still waiting. The impression I get from this awful experience is that Virgin Media make it as difficult as possible to cancel their services.

1691,"OK so this is now a part two of three I guess, my first was a couple of days ago, and an engineer has come out since then. Long story short, all was fine for 3 weeks, then for almost a week the system was working only at 12mbps anywhere really, then just literally minutes before the engineer slot was to happen, it jumped up to 80mbps in the living room (hub location) only. It fell back to 12mbps.  2 hours later, the system again jumped up to 80mbps in the living room and a better but paltry 30mbps in the kitchen, twelve feet of open doors away. Five minutes later, the engineer said he would be there in 5 minutes.  I know, right?! Engineer does his bit, discovers two faulty connections, and as a result of one the phone began working. The eventual decision to change the hub box seemed moot, as it behaved in the same, better, but changeable fashion. Here is the upshot of the visit:- faulty phone connection sorted- faulty/not fully plugged-in fibre connection pushed fully home- wifi began behaving as follows: Cyclical, seemed to go fast then slow in cycles of a few minutes.  I began to think virgin had a special way of throttling, that did not choke the data speed to a fixed low level, but cycled it high/low for five minutes each. Hitherto, I was able to treat power of wifi as inter-related with speed in mbps.  IE if we had 4 arcs of wifi, your speed was good. The virgin system is not like that.  I have wifi boosted it to heck and back, and it still just permits 12mbps.  this is too clever to be by accident - 12mbps just about permits HD video but of course the BBC iplayer, has dreadful and unusable lag at these speeds. 12 feet, and the signal has to take a left turn into our kitchen...dead.  From 87mbps, to 68mbps in the lobby then 14mbps in the kitchen. I find the entire matter confusing.  I think, there IS throttling of some type occurring, BUT another component has become apparent - I need to make use of my old ASUS 68 router it seems, that I used to avert all the BT hub problems we had, for similar reasons. Virgin in common with BT, seem to meddle regularly with their hubs/wifi units.  So, in short, the advice is to get into your virgin hub (xxx.xxx.x.x address you can google it) use the password off the bottom of the hub unit, and set it to : MODEM mode. Now, the virgin unit does not do wifi.  Now, you can use a decent unit to do that with, and ASUS certainly is an improvement.  It has aerials and stuff. So now, I will be able to deal with a known quantity, that won't update unless I make it, and the virgin unit just acts as a modem, not modem and router/hub. Basically, someone else online has a video and all they did apart from the settings thing, making virgin box modem only, was take a rj-45 and cat 5e or 6 cable, from virgin box to asus router. That's as far as my planning has got.  Part three, will be when I have solved this, by actually implementing a solution of the type outlined above. Setting the virgin hub to modem only, is by logging in to that xxx... address as above, then putting in the password on the bottom of the hub unit of virgin's, then it is in 'advanced' I think, or 'router' or something to set it to modem only. Back later with results, I cannot fathom a company producing the most advanced infrastructure in the company then lumbering customers with a creaky under-powered microwave unit (that's what wifi is). I also saw a guy advise on how to pump up the power of a BT hub to reach anywhere through walls galore, but my brother said ' You sleep right beside that hub don't you bro?' I think he was implying my brain would get fried.  I bought the ASUS and put tin foil behind it instead.  Part three later then...",2.0

1701,"Well, shucks, don't I wish I had read these reviews first. This is the end of September 2018, and about two weeks ago we had our Virgin installation and for about ten days it was almost incident-free bar some restarts out of nowhere, and my 'ookla' speedtest app on the ipad recorded 70mbps. That is the good news over. The entire town has been ringing to the sound of two-stroke stone cutters as pavement after pavement has a slot dug and fibre cable laid.  Now, I could carp and say as I am no longer full-time employed, this ruined the best summer weather-wise I can remember...but at 200mbps promised, it seemed churlish. Now, two warnings arose as the salesman pressed us - one, he did keep saying 'megabytes' to describe the speed.  It is rated in megabits per second or mbps for short. Two, he was not actually all that keen to flog us the 200mbps, preferring to labour on about cost savings per month and the 100mbps package. I will save you wondering why - when I called yesterday saying my 200mbps had dumped to 12mbps for the last 48 hours for no reason I could find, the obfuscation and lack of clear or helpful tech support came shining through. I did have to be pretty rude at times to for example, not accept the techies view that it was important I wasn't in the same room - I explained it was ten feet and an open door. He wouldn't shut up, motored on with a rapid wordage and accent that I could not figure at times.  I literally had to let it all float over me and just say what needed said at the end.  It was motormouth like sales patter is when it is flannel. He said it was the hub needed settings changed.  I was agape.  'Let me be clear, you want me to log into my hub and put the password in to make technical adjustments?!' I said absolutely gobsmacked. Yup, he wanted me to start adjusting widths of channels for the wifi. I stopped him.  NO I said.  The tv apps started to show a buffer circle, and then I went to the ipad app to check speeds on the line. The tv is hardwired into the virgin kit by the engineer.  It is all cables, I said.  All together.  It all worked and my app showed 70mbps until Wednesday midnight or so. It has crunched since then. I left BT because of incompetent technical support and installations botched.  (They used an old alarm cable - no really - to put the 70mbps signal through.  For the technical, it's got no shielding and it's only good for phone calls.  I installed it pre-broadband FFS.  It has no markings like cat 5 or cat 6 or cat V so the BT guy ought to have known.  Upshot - 8 months of intermittent failure and changing parts in my PC until I found out what the muppet had done. Anyway....I fixed that, and we just had to tolerate the very average mbps thereafter.) Back to Virgin...we have a tech appointment booked.  Now, Rakesh on the phone, said it is a hub that needs replaced.  I know this is unlikely.  I say, Virgin have throttled us back after a ten-day honeymoon, and it's gone to heck since half the town switched to Virgin, following the outrageous promises and the summer installing. I am an IT specialist.  It's not the box, unless the box has an emergency backstop to go to 13mbps or so, which it has now defaulted to, because some part is fried. Rakesh said initially it was an auto adjust patch of software that had failed to work properly, hence the manual attempt to make changes.   Blah blah. Not happy...I can smell what's coming, I will not have 11 months of this before bailing.  BT was better than this, even if it did take an ever-increasing sum of money and 18 months to get stable.  Oh, plus I got a good ASUS hub with three aerials, and a piece of tin foil behind that, to magnify/focus the wifi forward - it works. So here's the obvious rule emerging - it costs Â£1 per mbps to get broadband that's good, along with a phone line etc. per month. We are on a 200mbps with Virgin and the best I saw was 70mbps for ten days.  At half price of Â£34 per month - there you go, if it works, it is only 70mbps not 200 but that's good enough, and surprise, Â£1 per single mbps.  BT ended up at about Â£67 per month for 40mbps to 73mbps. They only came up once Virgin started digging and stone-cutting. This broadband lying thing, is so commonplace, not even regulators expect or can enforce anything else. The practical fix for us is to go back to BT and using the freeview channels on an ancient skybox and satellite dish. My problem is even if Virgin fixed this on Monday, at the tech appointment, I have no confidence until ten days or so are up, and if it plunges, that will likely be it for me. I don't want to argue all day with a tech guy I cannot understand.  I don't believe they know what they are doing, and they seemed pretty able to fob-off.  Were I less forceful or less knowledgeable, they might have told me it was ok, and signed me off when they tried to get me to watch the tv app and if it was ok, say all was good. Unpleasant, patronising, circular, I just find this tiresome, this broadband baloney.  I buy a car, I expect a 2 litre to be 1998cc at least.  Don't sell me broadband quoting 200mbps, lie about the faults that arise, then try and make me wear the 5% of that service I get soon after install. No, it won't do.",2.0

He kept telling me no discount possible but I hadn't asked for a discount, I was querying my previous bills. He them proceeded to give me a postal address to send my correspondence to.

Needless to say, the visit was declined. I accrued one and a half hours on hold on the phone after 6pm, just trying to find out where the tech was, without success.

I explained that no one has time to check every bill and confirm it against direct debits, in the same way that no one has time to read every term and condition before they sign up to anything.  He agreed but still refused to cancel the late charges.  If anyone had told me they were cancelling the direct debit (in any form of communication) I would have set up a new one.They have no idea how to retain customer goodwill.

1722,"I live in area 21, our Internet has been intermittently down for 6 months (yes... SIX MONTHS!). There has been an snr issue for over 6 months that virgin has failed to resolve. They have given fake estimated times of resolution which are never met, month after month we are assured that the Internet will be resolved by a given date. After that date, the Internet still drops. We receive drops outs of over 10 hours (the longest was 16 hours). The customer service is horrendous, they don't even (at minimum) call the people affected to even attempt to explain the matter. It's a whole post code that is affected yet that isn't a priority (the level of priority of P4. P1 is the highest level of priority, up to p6 I believe) We are not given even compensation for the utter inconvenience of over half a year of intermittent Internet. They just reimburse us for the time the Internet was down. If I go to a shop and buy something, or pay for a service and that service isn't acceptable, at bare minimum you are reimbursed with what you should have gotten, plus atleast store credit, ATLEAST. Virgin, with their horrendous customer service, have said they can only pay back the money for the down time. (to put that into perspective, if you pay 30 pounds a month for Internet, if your Internet is down for 24 hours, so one whole day, regardless of you having to eat I to your minutes calling them, then they put you in a queue and bounce you around for an hour, regardless of you having to use your own Internet, run out, purchase more Internet, regardless of the inconvenience that it caused if your whole family (a family of 5 in the house, all who use Internet) having to spend extra money in this fashion, regardless of deadlines you need to meet, research you need to do, personal things you want to watch online, coursework that needs to be completed, jobs that need to be applied to, YOU GET Â£1 BACK!! ONE POUND. For all of your troubles, you get a pound back. It's outrageous. You may question why we are still with virgin, it's because we have been promised time and time again that by a certain date the Internet will be fine and we will receive no issues after that. This has happened 4/5 times. It's disgusting, and virgin have not even reached a hand out in apology.  This is not the only issue. Although it is a major issue, they are also deceivers. Treacherous liars. They called us a few months back saying we needed to change our contract we had with them, threw a bunch of big fancy words at us and said our contract is ending and we need to change our to another, more expensive contract. We're not that dumb. We said we know our contract and we had no specific time frame to keep to. We had the proof to show that, and we didn't pay into a new contract. The next bill of ours went from Â£40 ish pounds to Â£50-Â£60!! So we called them, explained the issue, they apologised and reduced our bill to Â£10 less than our original bill (to Â£30). It's outrageous that such an issue would occur. Moreover, their customer service are so pretentious. I work in IT, I'm a second line engineer, I know my stuff. So when I call, I will speak to the customer service as I would speak to my own colleagues (specifically and precisely, using IT terms the layman may not understand). The customer service team, almost every time I call, as I speak they cut me off, they raise their voice over mine, they don't listen to me and continue talking as if what I'm mentioning makes no difference, at times they would speak rudely once they realise I'm not budging and will say my piece.  We have changed our router roughly 4 times. Virgin insisted the issue we faced (almost 7 months ago) was due to our router. After the 2nd time, we realised that this is a bigger issue than just our router. We mentioned to virgin that there is a bigger issue, to which they replied that they cannot do anything further than changing our router and checking the cables unless others in the area call up that their Internet is also down. One of the technicians came (quite fortunately) at the time of the Internet being down. He sat there confused as to why it was down. He plugged in another router ""just in case"" and we waited... Still no Internet. He was confused and said he's not sure what the issue is. A few months later they said there was an SNR issue (single noise reduction issue. Which is basically a faulty wire that sends data back up to the router in the back of everything and causes the problems I mentioned). So now that they know the issue, the fix is simple yet tedious. Find the wire if they hired me, ran me through things and gave me the equipment, I'd do it myself! But they can't even find the root cause of the issue, all these months later, nothing.  If a person wants an Internet service provider, don't go to virgin. Their amazing speed that they have means nothing whatsoever if you can't make use of it P.s... My Internet right now is down My area reference is 21 and my account number is 666078401",2.0

I went to a virgin store where they still cannot find me, although i got a letter that my direct debit has been setted up!!!From the store they gave another number to call, which I did, and when finally spoke to them after another 20+ minutes of waiting, they transferred me to another department which after 20 more minutes of waiting they just hung up on me!These Virgin guys are amazingly big liers and all they care is how to grab your money, even for services they won't provide, which basically is stealing!!!!!!!Of course not even a word for refund or any form of compensation so far...AVOID VIRGIN IN ANY COST!",2.0

They supposed to connect me at 25th July, but day before that date I've got information that there's some problem with cable on the street, which need to be exchanged and we need to wait 2 weeks. Ok, we understood, waited until 8th August. Day before that date I got a call, they can't do this, but they will connect us at 18th. I was angry, but what could I do? Later again day before installation I got a call that they found some blockade that they need to deal with, and they'll connect us at 31st.. Got really angry, after few harsh words I heard that they put us on priority list, when asked about discount we heard, that they can't do anything, but we will be connected soon. To make sure that we're finally going to have Internet I asked TalkTalk to connect us as well. Two days before virgin supposed to connect us.. Guess what, I got a call! Again saying that they can't do this on time, and we need to wait until 12th September! That was really bad joke. I said thank you, I want to cancel my appointment and finish agreement.

First issue was getting conflicting messages as to whether they knew there was an issue. Online service checker said it was fine, but automated phone call recognised an issue. Although it recognised an issue, it gave no eta of fix. Found it very difficult to get through to a human to discuss the issue. Most services are automated. Twitter team offer zero practical help, just generic bile. When you do get through to a person itâs an call centre where the staff have no access to in-depth network problems. Just the same old reset the router nonsense. Calling the problem intermittent, itâs not intermittent, it was completely out! Only when threatening to cancel, do you get to speak to someone who knows what they are talking about, which takes on average 45 minutes on hold to get through. The cancellation team are able to give an estimated fix date, but they have given me 2 dates now, both of which have been and gone. They claim the issue is only affecting a handful of houses, probably the reason they have no urgency to fix it. And just to round it off, got a letter through the post today saying the monthly bill is going up from October.",2.0

Files around 2 gig are not big at all. you watch a film on netflix it is around that size so why on earth are these idiots punishing me. 100% I wont be renewing and I will be advising others on their twitter ads to stay away from virgin media.  I suggest everyone that has be wronged by them to join their twitter feed. every time you see them advertising tweets about their services , be sure to comment in about how bad they are with throttling. They really fear this action against them because it essentially means they cant be successful using twitter to get more customers.",2.0
1858,"The internet is ok, as fast as advertised most times, even if quite unreliable, it let me down several times.The dreadful bit is the customer service. Sending email is not allowed, they have a chat which is unavailable 9 times out of 10 and never in the summer, and the wait times on the phone are dreadful.What's really bad, though, is that they tell you one thing and then don't do it.They told me they'd give me a 50Â£ voucher because they never told me they were increasing prices, and they never sent it. They told me my service would be cancelled automatically at the end of the contract, and I only found out this wasn't the case when I received the email that I had payed the month after the contract expired.I'm actually thinking of sueing them, because this is nothing short of a fraud",2.0
1859,"Awful service!Engineers installed cables completely differently as requested, left an eyesore on the driveway. we were then told the cables could not be buried. Connection kept dropping, when it was connected the speed was super slow! Kept calling for them to fix it and they said there was no problem. Engineers were supposed to come out and re-cable but never came, several people came out to 'have a look' but didn't know hat to do, called their managers who kept promising the issue would be fixed, it never was. One day someone even came 8 hours late and I was waiting to go out, when he arrived he said he couldn't do anything so my day was wasted. I managed to finally get through on the phone after various attempted to cancel during my free cancellation period, lost a few days of working from home I was not happy and was told I would not be compensated. Asked when they would be taking the cables away as I cancelled and was told I would have to remove them myself!!! Awful service, avoid at all costs!!",2.0

1861,"Broadband keeps disappearing every evening without a fail from 8 o clock onward. Sundays are bloody nightmares. When I was sold my package they guaranteed that my broadband speed wont fall below 41mb which turned out to be a complete lie. Technicians have been out and I was told that line can handle x amount of people and currently there are three times the amount of people connected to the same line and it cant handle it. Guess what- you will still charged the same amount of money even when you are not getting any services. O, needless to mention that technicians are not sent out in the evenings and weekends when services are overloaded. They can only pay you a visit during the day when broadband is not used as much and speed is relatively reasonable. So to sum it all up...If you want to buy top price Ferrari with a 1.2 litre engine which can only do 25 mph at the most... Go for Virgin! On a serious note- PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE RUN AWAY IF YOU HEAR VIRGIN MEDIA!!!!!! They take your money and dont provide you with what they promise....",2.0

Horrible service.",2.0
1863,"I have given one-star for speed and reliability, although I have not yet had time to test these.  This is mainly to re-inforce my one-star for customer service and overall satisfaction.  If possible, I would give this -10.  I placed my order for the Player Package, including Player TV and Weekend Calls but then I upgraded to Anytime Calls.  The advisor told me to choose the self-installation option and the installation date was agreed.  Then Virgin changed the installation date, because an engineer needed to do this.  In the meantime, they had contacted BT with the original installation date and BT were going to stop services on that date.  I found it extremely frustrating, trying to get them to keep to the original date â I went to about 4 departments and, each time, I had a 10 minute wait.  After threatenting to cancel the order, they managed to keep to the original date.  All the advisors I spoke to were based offshore and, although I have been advised that the calls are always dealt with both offshore and in the UK and that the calls just go to the next advisor, I would be interested to know the ratio of offshore to UK staff.  Some of the advisors just failed to appreciate the problem and I believe that one of them gave bad advice, just to pacify me.  When the order arrived,  I found that the advisor had logged the order incorrectly and I received only the WIFI and Phone.  I accept that I should have noticed that this was missing, when the email arrived with the order details, but I didn't.  On the installation date, I spent at least 3 hours trying to get this resolved.  I cut one call off after an hour, so it would not be charged to my bill.  Then I had to go through it all again.  I went to the department that dealt with 'home move leaver', got passed to Customer Services, got put through to Sales and then back to CS.  The original connection took about 20 minutes and then each transfer took about 10 minutes minimum.  My mistake was in selecting 'leaving due to home move', because I did not realise that there was 'leaving for any other reason', which is the one I should have gone to â this is the department that seemed to have any ability to understand and maybe do something to rectify this problem.  It may be co-incidence but I made this connection after 4pm and the advisor was based in the UK. I still had to wait 20 minutes to connect.  Unfortunately, although my account was active, their system had not been updated, so he could not progress any action at that time.  What he did say was that the order logged matched the installation order â in effect, it was my fault for not noticing and following up before installation.  I tried again, 2 days later on Sunday, today,  and was advised that the system still had not been updated â perhaps because it was a weekend â I can't see why this is the case.  I asked about my chat and was advised that these are kept for existing customers but not for others â again I can't see why.  This advisor was based in the UK and was extremely helpful â she has noted that, as soon as my account details are available, she will contact me and discuss what offers are available and, if possible, try to include my Player TV at no extra cost. I was with Virgin for 7 years and, often I had to negotiate around a price increase, at renewal time.  In the end, this was too much and I moved to BT.  I had very few problems over this period and any time I contacted them, all my calls went to UK advisors and I don't remember any long delays .  The current customer service at Virgin is abysmal â the delays are ridiculous and the quality of advice was dreadful.  I don't know whether Virgin's customer base has greatly extended and they have failed to increase the customer staff or whether they have reduced the levels of customer staff, to cut costs, or whether the amount of complaints and enquiries has reached unexpected peaks but someone, somewhere should be aware of the adverse impact the current customer service is having on Virgin's reputation.",2.0

But then after the first visit they will not send anyone out stating an intermittent fault in the area even though neighbours on the same street don't have any issues.

For the last 3 years, despite paying for the 100mbs package, I have had ongoing issues with speed, reliability and most notably, wireless signal. Despite MANY calls to their tech teams and eventually a replacement router, the service if anything has continued to deteriorate. One customer service agent admitted that Virgin Media have oversold their product in certain areas and do not have the capacity to provide the broadband speeds as advertised, or it seems, the reliability. Be vary wary of their advertised speeds - I have been unable to consistently achieve much over 20mbs at best via my wireless router for almost three years, despite having a 100mbs package.",2.0

If you live in the Stratford London area, please avoid using Virgin Media- there are many other cheaper options which end up giving the same speeds as Virgin.",2.0
1913,"Very unhappy with the customer service level of virgin media. Complain about the speed of my premium package kept fluctuating badly they said they couldn't do anything about it if the device was not connected via ethernet cable. I asked them to help me out they said yes but they would be a Â£99 callout charge for moving the router upstairs from downstairs. I waited for a week and one of their ""engineers"" came he literally stapled a cable to the barrister of the staircase and threw a large amount of cable wire upstairs, leaving it lying on the top of the stairs saying he could not do anymore. I had to spend the rest of my day sorting the wiring out neatly. Do not recommend this company, the customer database is big enough they don't care about new customers.",2.0

Back in March 2018 i stated id like to reduce my Broadband, Tv & Phone package as im want to save some money due to moving within the next few months ( Remember all calls are recorded ) So i stated im moving within the NEXT FEW MONTHS. package dropped for me & they stated my tv box was out of date so im entitled to a free box as ive been a VALUED customer for 23yrs. yep a long time.... The point to this is i have now moved and contacted them about my move & id like to keep my service at my new place thats out of town. BUT? got told they dont supply cable to that AREA. little gutted as always had a great service from them. yes i was happy till i get told they put me on another 12 Month contract ( Remember i stated at the beginning i am moving within the next couple of months ) NOT Happy i stated listen to the recorded message & i stated i am moving so that member of STAFF should of said due to you moving i would advice not to change your package untill you move or it will put you on another 12 month contract & im sure all would agree here with me as i also deal with customers. also she should had stated what the address to your new place so we can check we have cable in that area. yet again another customer service point that should be asked but was not ( they can also listen back to the recording ) so with me now one unhappy customer being told i have 8 months to pay for and me stating all ive said above to listen back & also to hold that recording on file for me to take matters to court if need be, her reply was thats fine you take us to court as you will lose as we are a big company and will all cases and you will end up paying court cost... Then at that point i was more than pissed off with that kinda customer service & i stated if she worked for me you would be sacked on the spot for that kinda attitude....

I on my left virgin before because they were expensive. Now they have a Â£29 deal for all 3 services I tried all others and they charge more for once virgin is the cheapest.

My package is normally (Â£45) the fact I was paying Â£20 extra was already enough and they stil have the audacity to send me a Â£105 bill. I gladly finally have cancelled my contract with them and every time I tried to in the past, they made excuses! Iâm glad to get rid of them.  Is. After cancelling my contract. They stil sent me payments like Â£104 once again so I had cancelled my direct debit with them! Now they are asking for the box and hub back which I find really stingy as I had Been with sky before and sky have never asked anything like that. We are sending our rubbish boxes back which were a waste of time and money and they will basically use these boxes for other customers which means I had been sent a second handed one too. Wow virgin. I hav no words. If they send me another payment. I will be taking it to the court and see what they say about this fraud.",2.0
1919,"My beef is this. I have a home office but often work away from home. I also need to divert my phone from time to time to a colleague. Virgin have a phone divert package - although it took endless calls and research on line to find this out - however, you can only operate it by physically standing in front of your landline and punching in the divert codes. All other telephony companies I have used in the past offered a package with a remote call divert on-off option. But NOT Virgin. Not only that, but their call divert fee is higher! I have to text a housemate every time and get them to do it. Also, the call divert is just a couple of clicks (no vice saying that it has happened), so sometimes you think it's switched over, when it hasn't. Really primitive.Poor.",2.0

Six hours later it finally gets sorted at 6.10pm well after the close of business day causing my company a loss of business of an entire day, all because of an installation not properly tested beforehand, as opposed to a lightening strike, or bad weather and not admitting it was their fault on the first call but on the third call lol.  I had to speak to one of their technicians on the street to get the real story.  The phone team is a joke.  I am leaving and going to Sky right away (not that I trust any of them really).  Your promises are ridiculous, you give no power to your managers who are really supervisors anyway, and your reaction, we will give you money for the lost time online.

The last stint I was transferred repeatedly until the 13p/min had climbed to 30 minutes.

It comes back on again eventually, but it's so frustrating when it goes off in the middle of a film, every day! As a comparison, I lived in my old house 9 years and I think the BT broadband went off once.

The final straw came when I told if I want to disconnect the service that was my decision. Surprise, surprise when I call the disconnections team they offer to send an engineer! Apparently, Virgin and other broadband companies do not supply WiFi so if you have a problem you're on your own.  Perhaps I should connect all 8 of the gadgets to the box with a cable!

On a positive note the staff are all friendly and no matter how irrated you get they remain calm - I am guessing practice does make perfect!
